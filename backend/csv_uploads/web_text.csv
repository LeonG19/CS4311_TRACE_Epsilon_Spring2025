We re continuing to create a culture of inclusion belonging collaboration where everyone can do their best work Inclusion that reflects world around us Inclusion We build features that make technology more accessible We build features that make technology more accessible For many team members customers in deaf hard of hearing community sign language interpretation is critical but having an interpreter on hand isn t always an option So a diverse group of people across multiple teams at Apple came together to provide access to interpretation on short notice Traditional in person sign language interpretation services require booking in advance are challenging to scale especially in context of customer service internal teams So this cross functional group collaborated to create an experience that would be a viable immediate alternative for Apple customers employees alike We considered not just what would be adequate support but what would really deliver an experience that recognizes embraces people s differences cultures says Antony Kennedy People Accessibility result of these efforts is SignTime SignTime helps people communicate with AppleCare Retail Customer Care in their web browsers using American Sign Language ASL in United States Canada British Sign Language BSL in United Kingdom French Sign Language LSF in France In 2023 service launched in Australia Japan where it is known as HandTime Germany where it is known as SignChat Spain Italy Korea In addition to in person interpreters customers visiting Apple Store locations can use SignTime to access a sign language interpreter remotely without booking ahead of time At Apple we provide tools for our team to do their best work Equitable access to language is especially powerful within deaf community SignTime is a step forward in that direction says Gus Shitama Global Accessibility Policy Initiatives SignTime has already made a difference in how team connects both with each other with customers After SignTime was released I felt a stronger sense of belonging because it bridged communication gap that previously existed says Ricky Winarta Apple Carnegie Library This made it easier to build relationships removed any unnecessary barriers when typing back forth with customers coworkers made customer s experience better UP NEXT Our products services are designed to be inclusive Our products services are designed to be inclusive Since our earliest days inclusivity has been fundamental to our design process We consider inclusivity at every step this work requires close collaboration among a wide range of teams One such effort involved Face ID where cross functional teams came together to ensure that our machine learning model had extensive diverse data This meant taking into account a huge range of facial feature variations coverings in order to build something that works for people with light dark skin for people of every age for all kinds of facial shapes for people who are fully sighted blind have low vision Our focus on inclusive design remains a priority we re working to be even more inclusive Jerremy Holland Joshua Cohen of Apple University Denise Hui of AIML created Inclusive Products Initiative an internal knowledge sharing website network for anyone at Apple interested in inclusive product design As part of this initiative Inclusion Diversity team developed a workflow that lets product design teams connect with Diversity Network Associations DNAs which are open to all employees to review their work In addition Apple University created Technology for All of Us an inclusivity course that uses case studies from inside outside Apple to examine how to weigh right considerations including potential trade offs ultimately make informed choices course description aptly sums it up Technology for All of Us encourages you to consider what it means to build for humanity in all its variety why it matters Our role is not to do work for people to tell people what to do to look under hood before something goes out door says Cohen Our job is to empower people who have responsibility to develop inclusive products That is way to create something sustainable Together these efforts help inspire a culture where being inclusive by design becomes an inherent part of everyone s process UP NEXT We re building connections community for Veterans We re building connections community for Veterans Our comprehensive benefits are designed to help every Apple employee their family feel healthy supported secure For Veterans navigating transition from

Music Apple Fitness Apple News Apple Health Apple Global Events more collaborate to build campaigns that bring Apple employees together For International Women s Day these teams invited women nonbinary creators from inside outside Apple to share their work Occasions like these give us opportunity to rally around important causes make a positive impact They also create opportunity to express shared values be part of something bigger together For Pride Month LGBTQ employees from Apple Retail Engineering Finance all shared their personal experiences Their stories were featured in a

creative expression Local businesses nonprofit organizations city agencies commission these projects kids gain real world experience working with clients They use iPad devices to film mural making process have even used digital animation software on iPad to project their mural designs onto city buildings In addition to broadening their capabilities as artists YAM helps its participants leverage art to speak to issues directly affecting their communities YAM program encouraged us to help people shed light on different topics says Aliyah Pflueger a YAM student artist who applied to program as a way to help develop her creative abilities We have a voice through this program to say something People want to hear what kids have to say what s going on around them We re telling our story helping

overlooked last Canadian residential school closed in 1997 further fueling movement toward teaching more First Nations culture history today In 2015 Assembly of First Nations AFN gathered First
