Spam Discord uses a proactive spam filter to protect experience of our users health of platform. Sending spam is against our Terms of Service Community Guidelines. We may take action against any account, bot, server using tactics described below similar behavior. Receiving unsolicited messages ads is a bad experience for users. These are some examples of DM spam for both users bots: Join 4 Join is process of advertising for others to join your server with promise to join their server in return. This might seem like a quick fun way to introduce people to your server to join new communities, but thereas a thin line between Join 4 Join spam. Even if these invitations are not unsolicited, they might be flagged by our spam filter. Sending a large number of messages in a short period of time creates a strain on our service. That may result in action being taken on your account. While we do want you to find new communities friends on Discord, we will enforce rate limits against spammers who might take advantage of this through bulk joins bulk requests. Joining a lot of servers simultaneously sending a large number of friend requests might be considered spam. In order to shut down spambots, we take action against accounts that join servers too frequently, send out too many friend requests at one time. majority of Discord users will never encounter our proactive spam filter, but if, for example, you send a friend request in just a few minutes to everyone you see in a thousand-person server, we may take action on your account. Instead of joining too many servers at once, we recommend using Server Discovery to find active public communities on topics youare passionate about. Servers dedicated to mass copy-paste messaging, encouraging DM advertising, are considered dedicated spam servers. Many servers have popular bots which reward active messaging. We donat consider these to be spambots, but spam messages to generate these bot prompts is considered abuse of our API, may result in our taking action on server and/or users who participate in mass messaging. Besides cheating those systems, sending a large number of messages in a short period of time harms platform. Invite reward servers are servers that promise some form of perk, often financial, for inviting getting other users to join said server. A We strongly discourage this activity, as it often results in spamming users with unsolicited messages. If it leads to spam another form of abuse, we may take action including removing users server. If a bot contacts you to be added to your server, asks you to click on a suspicious link, please report it to our Trust & Safety team for investigation. We donat create bots to offer you free products. This is a scam. If you receive a DM from a bot offering you something, asking you to click on a link, report it. We understand allure of free stuff. But weare sorry to say these bots are not real. Do not add them to your server in hopes of receiving something in return as they likely will compromise your server. If anything gets deleted, we have no way of restoring what was lost.

Understanding Avoiding Common Scams Social Engineering Social engineering is a manipulation tactic used by bad actors to trick individuals into divulging sensitive personal information. bad actor often poses as a trustworthy entity, offering a seemingly beneficial exchange of information.

Discord Staff Impersonation Sometimes attackers try to impersonate Discord staff to gather information. To use this tactic, they hack into Discord accounts, then convince an accountas friends list that they've aaccidentally reported them.a They encourage them to reach out to ""Discord Employees"" to resolve issue.

For young people in particular, online spaces can be great for hanging out with friends, building social circles, forming identity at a key juncture in life. Technology also removes geographical limits placed on friendships allows people to find like-minded peers much more freely. Itas important to have opportunities to connect with people who are into same things, whether those are passions, causes, an identity. Coming together online can help people find community, help buildA genuine connections. On Discord, that may happen in servers focused on a favorite sports team, video game, TV show. Servers can be small intimate, with just your core friend group who might use it for hanging out chatting. They can also be larger spaces for more people to share ideas, organized around identities, including neurodivergence, disabilities, LGBTQ communities; as well as special interests like music, art, tech. For some people, spaces like these offer support social connection that might be hard to come by where they live. aEspecially as an LGBTQ young person, being able to find a space, be it online in person, can literally be life-saving if they come from an unsupportive community,a said Patricia Noel, Discordas mental health policy manager a licensed social worker. aJust being able to find people who accept you, who use your pronouns a all I can say is that it can be a life-saving experience for young people to be able to come on Discord to find community.a More people are talking about mental health Many young people use Discord servers to support each other as they navigate a difficult stage in life. In servers focused on peer support with mental health, members gather to discuss what theyare struggling with build community around helping one another. These spaces created managed by users arenat replacements for mental health professionals, but they offer an accessible reliable space to be heard, Noel said. Young people look to communities of friends for validation support, theyare at an age in life when that has a significant impact on their sense of self. aYoung people are really invested in their mental health. They want to be having these conversations,a Noel said. aThey're so open about what they're experiencing feeling, even way that they support each other is amazing. They're asking right questions, theyare so in tune with one another, theyare such an empathetic group.a In spaces dedicated to discussing mental health, people may feel more free to share things they arenat yet comfortable sharing elsewhere. They can show up in a space thatas designed to offer words of validation affirmation, offer that same kind of support back to others. aThereas a lot of research coming out around benefits of peer support just being able to talk to somebody who's gone through what youare going through, who's just within your same age bracket,a Noel said. aIt ends up being beneficial for person seeking support as well as person who is supporter.a Building positive spaces for online communities experience of hanging out with friends is central to Discord. Servers are all about conversation a text, voice, video a because thatas how people build genuine connections, in real world online. Conversations happen at both server level also one-on-one with smaller groups in Direct Messages, DMs. We think of this in contrast to social media apps that are built for broadcasting likes, driven by algorithms that monopolize usersa attention. When all your time is spent on shallow interactions endless feeds of other people seemingly living their best lives, itas hard to feel better more connected. Often, opposite is true: research published in Journal of Medical Internet Research found that social comparison on digital platforms, where people judge themselves against others they see online, is aa significant risk factor for depression anxiety.a Experiences of quality interactions social support online, on other hand, are related to lower levels of depression anxiety. good news is we know how online communities can bring people together. internet can still provide new solutions to peopleas need for social connection, Discord is committed to fostering safe, healthy, supportive spaces on our platform. aThe internet isnat going anywhere. It's a tool that young people use, it's going to continue to be a part of their lives,a Noel said. aThey want to be part of solutions. They want to be included when it comes to deciding what happens next.a Words Matter 1. Keep it simple. When designing safety alerts, Discord uses plain language, avoids idioms metaphors, keeps sentences words short when possible. This makes alerts easier to understand in moment, without overloading users with information. This can be particularly useful for users who may be in a heightened emotional state, for example, if they just got a notification that they violated Discordas anti-harassment policy they want to report someone else for harassing them. Our design team tries to put themselves in teensa shoes in those moments. To imagine what their emotional state might be at time. simpler we can make options for them, better. We try to make it easier for them to move through flow so they are clear about what's supposed to happen. Simple language is timeless. It isnat trendy metaphorical. it translates better across different languages cultures. Take for example when a teen receives a DM from a user for first time Discord may provide some helpful education about online safety. a 2. Guide, donat reprimand. With features like Discordas Teen Safety Alerts, Discord partnered with a leading child safety non-profit Thorn to design features with teensa online behavior in mind. goal is to empower teens to build their own online safety muscleanot make them feel like they've done something wrong. So Discord builds teachable moments guidance into our products, using language that aims to restore useras sense of control, without shaming them. aWith teens, because they can't opt out of some of these alerts, we want it to feel more like a guideaa guardrail versus a speed bump,a said Passmore, lead product designer for Safety team. aA speed bump is saying, aHey, you're doing something wrong, you need to check yourself.a But we built Teen Safety Alerts to feel more like guidance.a This alert will encourage them to double check if they want to reply, will provide links to block user view more tips for staying safe. goal is to empower teens by providing information that helps them make important decisions to protect themselves. a 3. Show that youare listening can help them regain control. When a teen encounters potentially harmful sensitive content has a run-in with another user who is acting hostile, they, too, may be in an activated emotional state. They may be angry at other person, even at themselves. This is common with cyber-bullying, which researchers say can lead to depression feelings of low self-esteem isolation. Our approach is to meet them in that mindset. This means offering them options reminding them that they have options like blocking a person reporting a message. We create a space to acknowledge what theyare experiencing. Itas also important not to dwell on upsetting incident. Instead, Discord uses language that aims to move teen out of that emotional state into a place of self-awareness. This can help them to calm down feel more in control. A usersa mindset matters to Discord. That is why we try choose our words so carefully to support in best possible way. How do you define troll-y? Defining terms One of main challenges for Platform Policy team is writing rules for content that isnat so clearly defined. Riggio notes that for most severe violations, such as posting illegal material making an imminent threat of physical harm, line between whatas allowed whatas prohibited is bright red. Discord has a strict policy for those types of violations clear processes in place for removing content banning user. But for content where there arenat legal definitions even clear societal ones, like for bullying harassment, line is more gray. Landing on a definition starts with posing a fundamental question, said Riggio: aWhat is problem that weare trying to solve here on Discord?a How team goes about answering that challenge becomes guiding force behind each policy. For bullying harassment, team looks at user experience. We donat want people to experience psychological emotional harm from other users.A aThe spirit of policy is focused on individual community experience building healthy interactions,a Riggio said. Because ultimately, Discord is a place where everyone can find belonging, experiencing these feelings hinder people from doing that. team did a rigorous amount of research including reviewing other platforms reviewing guidance from industry groups, including Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism Tech Coalition, which was formed so companies could share best intelligence resources when it comes to child safety online. They also read academic literature on what it looks like in society. They also brought in subject matter experts from different countries, such as academics who study harassment legal scholars who can offer additional context for how platforms should be thinking about policies enforcement. These experts provided feedback on early drafts of policies. They defined bullying as unwanted behavior purposefully conducted by an individual group of people to cause distress intimidate particular individuals, harassment as abusive behavior towards individuals groups of people that contributes to psychological reputational harm that continues over time. Policies like this one are only as useful if they are enforceable. So team identified two dimensions that must be taken into account when assessing content. First, intent of instigator. These are signals that user server is posting content deliberately is intending to cause harm. Intent isnat always easy to spot, but Riggio said just as in real life, there are signs. For example, a user is directly harassed by someone, there have been multiple instances of harassment in past. aWhat happens in society happens online. What happens in your high school can sometimes happen on Discord,a she said. second, is content targeted? Is it targeting a specific individual by name? Is it targeting a specific individual by group? Here, there could also be dimensions of targeting users groups because of certain protected characteristics, such as race gender, which would then be considered a violation of Discordas Hate Speech policy. How this policy covers trolling term trolling has many dimensions. Itas been used to normalize aedgy behavior,a Riggio said. aTrolling in of itself is a complicated term, because some communities that intend to cause harm downplay their behavior with, aWe're just trolling,aa Riggio said. Trolling on Discord takes on different dimensions. From ""server raids"", when a group of users joins a server at same time to cause chaos, to ""grief trolling"", when someone attempts to make jokes degrades deceased their next of kin, this type of negative behavior is rooted in disruption harassment, is not tolerated on our platform -- no matter how harmless instigators may think it is. aI hate saying asticks stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me,a because words hurt,a said Patricia Noel, Discordas mental health policy manager who is a licensed social worker has a background in youth mental health. She collaborates cross-functionally within Discord with external partners, such as Crisis Text Line, with goal of providing tools resources to teens who may be experiencing mental health challenges. Why education is as important as enforcement Part of enforcement strategy for bullying harassment is to include a series of warnings, with escalating enforcement actions aimed at educating users, namely teens, that certain behaviors are not OK on Discord. a aThis generation is really empathetic. But I also know that there are people who go online just for sake of going online being a troll,a Noel said. aThose might be very same folks who are having problems at home, who are dealing with their own mental health well being issues. They might not immediately recognize that they are doing harm to someone else.a Understanding that young people are going to make mistakes is reflected in how new warning system handles suspensions. For lower harm violations falling under Bullying Harassment policy, Discord will test suspensions rather than permanent bans. idea here is that some teens may need a long pause before coming back to platform, given how much growth development occurs during each year of adolescence. while there will always be a zero-tolerance policy for most serious violations, Discord will focus on remediation, when appropriate, for topics like bullying harassment. This is so teens can have an opportunity to pause, acknowledge that they did something wrong, hopefully change their behavior. challenge is that behavior is so wide-ranging, said Ben Shanken, Discordas Vice President of Product. He pointed to a recent analysis by Discord that looked at reports of bullying in large, discoverable servers. aIf you put these examples on an SAT test asked, aIs this bullying? Many people probably would answer questions incorrectly,a he said, noting how Discordas large teen user base is inclined to atroll-ya behavior. In one example, Shanken shared how teens were trolling each other by deceptively reporting their friends to Discord for supposedly being underage when in fact they were not. Itas trolling. While itas not nice, itas also part of how teens joke around. But, instead of simply banning offender, we build in an opportunity where they can learn from their mistake. aIf we ban a person, they don't know what they did wrong, they likely won't change their behavior,a said Shanken. aGiving them a warning saying, here's what you did wrong, flips script in a more constructive way. At its core, Discord is a place where people can come together to build genuine friendships. Educating users, especially young people, through our warning system is one part of Discordas holistic strategy to cultivate safe spaces where users can make meaningful connections. nature of being a teenager navigating relationships can be tricky. There are going to be situations where you hurt people's feelings. There may be moments where users lose their cool say something really mean even vaguely threatening,a Riggio said. aWe want to build in more of a runway for them to make mistakes online but also learn from them.a Remediation: Why you canat ban your way to a safe platform Discordas remediation philosophy Our approach to remediation is inspired by restorative justice, a concept from criminal justice that prioritizes repairing harm over punishment. Discordas Community Guidelines exist to keep people communities safe, itas important to make sure everyone knows how why to follow them. still, when people break rules, most of time they deserve a chance to correct themselves show that theyave learned. When users break an online platformas rules, they donat always do so intentionally. Consider how many different platforms someone might use in a day, each with their own rules expectations. Discord needs to enforce its own Community Guidelines, while understanding that a user who violates Guidelines might not even know they had broken a rule in first place. aA lot of users have their own aterms of servicea that may be different from ours,a said Jenna Passmore, Discordas senior staff product designer for safety. Admins moderators set rules, norms, expectations for their own servers on top of Discordas Community Guidelines Terms of Service, users may not know when theyare breaching rules of a server platform. aIf there's a mismatch there, itas not a severe violation, we don't want to kick them off platform.a Instead, Discord wants to teach people how to stay in bounds keep themselves, their friends, their communities safe fun for everyone. And, to be clear, when it comes to most severe violationsasuch as those involving violent extremism anything that endangers exploits childrenaDiscord will continue to have a zero-tolerance policy. Putting users in charge of outcomes In most cases, breaking Discordas Community Guidelines triggers a series of events that are aimed at returning user to their community with a better understanding of how they should behave. Education comes first. When Discord spots a violation, it lets a user know what specific thing they did wrong. Theyare prompted to learn more, in plain language, about that rule why it matters. Nobody expects someone to memorize full Community Guidelines Terms of Service, but this is best moment to help them learn what they need to know. Consequences come next. Any penalties we impose are transparent match severity of violation. A first-time, low-level violation, for example, could prompt a warning, removal of offending content, a cooling-off period with temporary restrictions on account activity. When action Discord takes to enforce its Community Guidelines takes proper measure of violation provides users a path back to good standing, users can often return to their community with a greater understanding of rules need to change their own behavior. If users stay on good terms, similar violations in future will play out roughly same way. If they continue to break rules frequently, violations stack up, so do consequences. idea is to provide users an opportunity to learn from their mistakes, change their behavior, therefore stay in communities they know trust on Discord, rather than pushing users who violate Discordas Community Guidelines off platform to other spaces that tolerate encourage bad behavior. aWe want users to feel like they have some agency over what's going to happen next,a Passmore said. aWe want an avenue for folks to see our line of thinking: You violated this policy, this is what we're doing to your account. Learn more about this policy, please don't do this again. If you do it again, here's what's going to happen to your account.a Banning is reserved for most extreme cases, highest-harm violations result in immediate bans. Otherwise, if someone repeatedly demonstrates that they wonat play by rules, consequences become more severe, from losing access to their account for a month, to a year, eventuallyaif they continue to violate Community Guidelinesafor good. Everyone knows where they stand Remediation depends on users who are able to learn change their behavior being able to return to good standing. Discordas account standing meter lets users see how their past activity affects what theyare able to do on platform. standing meter has five levels: good, limited, very limited, at risk, banned. aFor most folks, it will always be agooda,a Passmore said. When itas not, hope is that someone will act more thoughtfully so they can return to that good status stay there. She compared it to road signs that show risk level for wildfires. aIt changes your behavior when youare driving through a national park you see that thereas a moderate fire risk,a she said. Discordas internal policies outline severity of each type of violation, appropriate consequence, how one type of violation compares to others. These policies help ensure that employees who review violations of Discordas Community Guidelines enforce rules fairly consistently. That means when someone breaks rules, employees arenat deciding punishment on an ad hoc basis. Instead, outcome is determined by severity number of violations. aOur goal is to help people act better,a said Ben Shanken, Discordas vice president of product, who oversees teams that work on growth, safety, user experience. aPeople don't always know that they're doing bad things, giving them a warning can help them to improve.a Ultimately, we believe that guiding users toward better behavioraand giving them tools they need to learnaresults in a better experience for everyone. Bringing Policies to Life Discordas policy team invests time resources into understanding dynamics of type of behavior theyare writing policies about. aThe team does a significant amount of research to understand: What is phenomenon? What does this issue look like on other platforms? What does issue look like in society?a said Bri Riggio, senior platform policy manager who oversees this process. policy team reviews scholarly research, data, nonprofit industry guidance, among other resources. They bring in external subject matter experts from around globe, like academics who study online behavior legal scholars who focus on sexual harassment. They also do internal research. They interviewed Discordas Trust & Safety teamathe ones who review content for violationsato see examples of what they consider bullying harassment.A One thing policy team keeps in mind during this stage is how this research pertains to teens. aTeens are at forefront of my researchathinking about how we protect young people who are online making sure they feel safe comfortable using Discord,a said Edith Gonzalez, a platform policy specialist. She added that she looks for research that addresses parents' concerns when it comes to issues such as cyberbullying. At heart of each policy, Riggio her team start by asking question: What is problem that we are trying to solve on Discord? She calls this idea aspirita of policy. aIf we are trying to stop users from feeling psychological emotional harm from other users, if we want them to have a good experience, then we write policy to try drive towards that north star,a she said. aIt can be a guiding force for us, especially when we get escalations edge cases where policy may not be so clear cut.a For example, if Trust & Safety team gets a report of content that was flagged for bullying, but content falls somewhere in a gray area itas not clear if content was intentional, team discusses if taking action under policy is actually going to solve problem not. Another way of putting it: Does it go against spirit of policy? These discussions inform how policy team can sharpen better articulate policies over time. Policy specialists like Gonzalez begin listing all different behaviors that describe issue. For bullying harassment, examples might include: sexual harassment, server raids, sending shock content, mocking a person's death. aOnce I write down all criteria, I expand each behavior,a said Gonzalez. aHow do you define a violent tragedy? How do you define mocking? How do you define unwanted sexual harassment? Slowly, policy starts off as a list, then I keep expanding it.a For this policy, we define bullying as unwanted behavior purposefully conducted by an individual group of people to cause distress intimidate, harassment as abusive behavior towards an individual group of people that contributes to psychological reputational harm that continues over time. Riggio points out significance of sustained behavior. Itas an acknowledgment that context matters. For example, what may be friendly banter joking between individuals could be misconstrued as harassment, not taking into account that friends sometimes joke around with each other. aWe would be potentially over-enforcing policy with users who are just having fun with each other.a Research experience tell us that people donat always know rules, when appropriate, they need an opportunity to learn from their mistakes. Discord built a warning system that helps educate users, especially teens. (Important note: warning system does not apply to illegal more harmful violations, such as violent extremism endangering children. Discord has a zero-tolerance policy against those activities.) aThere's a perception that teens will roll their eyes at a rule, they don't like rules, but reality is, teens really like it when there are clear rules that resonate with them,a said Liz Hegarty, Discordas global teen safety policy manager. Once they learn rule, they might slip up again, so policy team built in several opportunities to educate teens that bullying isnat allowed. These show up in form of a series of time-outs, versus a flat-out ban after a few strikes, as is common on other platforms. aItas teen-centered,a said Hegarty. aIt's this idea of: how can you educate as opposed to just punishing teenagers when they're making mistakes?a This, too, reflects spirit of Bullying Harassment policy, because ultimately, Discord wants to empower people to build meaningful relationships on platform. aThe spirit is intended to get at various behaviors that we know make users feel uncomfortable,a said Riggio. aThatas behavior that impacts feelings of safety culture of a community.a Our Approach to Content Moderation Moderation across Discord All users have ability to report behavior to Discord. User reports are processed by our Safety team for violative behavior so we can take enforcement actions where appropriate. Discord also works hard to proactively identify harmful content conduct so we can remove it therefore expose fewer users to it. We work to prioritize highest harm issues such as child safety violent extremism. We use a variety of techniques technology to identify this behavior, including: In larger communities, we may use automated means to proactively identify harmful content on platform enforce our Terms of Service Community Guidelines.A If we identify a violation, we then determine appropriate intervention based on content conduct take action such as removing content suspending a user account. result of our actions are conveyed to users through our Warning System. Creating a safe teen experience In addition to all measures we've outlined above, we add layers of protection for teen users. Our proactive approach for teens has additional layers of safe keeping because we believe in protecting most vulnerable populations on Discord. For teens, we may monitor content activity associated with teen accounts to identify possible situations of unwanted messages through Teen Safety Assist. For example, if we detect potentially unwanted DM activity directed at a teen account, we may send a safety alert in chat to give teen account information about how they might handle situation. (For messages between adults, we do not proactively scan read content by default.) Together we are building a safer place for everyone to hang out. To stay up to date on our latest policies check out our Policy Hub. Culture of Safety What do we mean by safety? When we talk about protecting users, weare talking about preventing them from anything that could cause harm. That includes things like harassment, hateful conduct, unwanted interactions from others, inappropriate contact, violent abusive imagery, violent extremism, misinformation, spam, fraud, scams, other illegal behavior. Itas a broad set of experiences, but each of them can affect someoneas life negatively in real ways. They also degrade overall experience of community where they happen. In addition to keeping users safe, we also need them to feel safe. Thatas why we talk openly about our work, publish safety metrics each quarter, give everyone access to resources in our Safety Center. A culture of safety starts with people building technology Discordas commitment to safety is reflected in its staff way we build our products. Over 15% of our staff works directly on team that ensures our users have a safe experience. We invest time resources here because keeping users safe is a core responsibility: Itas central to our mission to create best place to hang out online talk to friends. Our safety work includes experts from all parts of company, with a wide range of backgrounds. These experts are engineers, product managers, designers, legal experts, policy experts, more. Some have worked in technology, but also social work, teen media, human rights, international law. Building a diverse team like this helps ensure we get a 360-degree view on threats risks, best ways to protect against them. We also invest in proactively detecting removing harmful content before it is viewed experienced by others. During fourth quarter of 2023, 94% of all servers that were removed were removed proactively. Weave built specialized teams, formed external partnerships with industry experts, integrated advanced technology machine learning to keep us at cutting edge of providing a safe experience for users. Getting users engaged in safety While rules technical capabilities lay foundation, users play a central part in making servers safe for themselves others. Our Community Guidelines clearly communicate what activities arenat allowed on Discord. We warn, restrict, even ban users servers if they violate those rules. But we donat want to spend our days chastising punishing people, we donat want people to worry that theyare always at risk of being reported. Thatas no way to have fun with friends. Instead, we help users understand when theyave done something wrong nudge them to change their behavior. When people internalize rules that way, they recognize when they, someone else, might be breaking them. They discuss rules organically, in process build a shared sense of what keeps their community safe in good standing. This has a multiplier effect on our work to build safer spaces: Users act with greater intention they more proactively moderate themselves their communities against unsafe actions. When communities have this shared commitment to rules, theyare also more likely to report harmful activity that could put an otherwise healthy community at risk. Changing safety narrative Itas sometimes said in technology that a platform canat really reduce harm block bad actors from doing bad things. Instead, those actions have to be addressed after they happen, when theyare reported detected. At Discord, we have loftier goals than that. We actually want to reduce harm. We want to make it so hard for bad actors to use our platform that they donat even try. For everyone else, we want to build products provide guidance that make safety not just a technical accomplishment, but a cultural value throughout our company communities we support. How Do aTeensa Rightsa Show Up in Discordas Enforcement Policies? What is a teensa rights approach? A teensa rights approach honors young peopleas experience, including areas where they could use a little helpasay, when they push boundaries just a little too far succumb to peer pressure engage in inappropriate behavior online. idea comes from United Nationsa guidance on impact of digital technologies on young peopleas lives. For report, committee members consulted with governments, child experts, other human rights organizations to formulate a set of principles designed to aprotect fulfill childrenas rightsa in online spaces. committee also engaged those at center of reportayoung people themselves. UNas guidance was not only rooted in research, it treated teens with respect. It listened to them. It's this kind of holistic human rights approach that makes this body of work so influential, especially for child rights advocates. But itas also become a guiding force for Discord. aTeens are going to try things out, figure out who they are, make mistakes online. Discord is focused on guiding them through that process without being overly punitive cutting them off from their support networks their friends,a said Laney Cloyd, a senior product policy specialist. Cloyd her colleagues set out to construct a new warning system for when a teen breaks Discordas rules. They started with idea that young people are going to do regrettable things, like send their friend a link that says, aFortnite cheats herea aCute kitten picsa itas really an IP grabber. They may think it's funny not harmful, but itas still against rules. aWe can't be super punitive on first violation, because they don't know. We have to teach them,a said Cloyd. Of course, when someone violates rules, there should be consequences. But a teensa rights approach considers a personas potential to changeacall it a teachable moment. Teens need extra opportunities to figure out what boundaries are. Itas true when theyare at home with their parents, when theyare at school with their teachers, when theyare on platforms like Discord with its own set of community guidelines. Parents, teachers, coaches are there to tell young people whatas what. Discord saw an opportunity to play that role online: We built interactive educational moments that explain to a person what they did wrong. aAs opposed to just saying, ayou're kicked off, go read our guidelines,a we offer more guidance so they can do better,a said Liz Hegarty, Discordas global teen policy manager. Hegarty pointed to research that shows teens really aren't given great advice about how to handle themselves online. Platforms have a role to play in helping teens build their digital citizenship skills. All of this is part of Discordas philosophy for designing policies that hangs on belief that people are capable of change if you give them a chance, especially when those people are young still learning. They need a chance at rehabilitation. (An important caveat is that some violations are more serious than others, Discord takes appropriate action depending on severity of violation. For example, we have will continue to have a zero-tolerance policy towards violent extremism content that sexualizes children.) It might sound odd that a tech company would borrow ideas from preeminent human rights organization. But consider most foundational tenet of human rights: right to live freely safely. Platforms like Discord are most successful when they enable people to be themselves, have fun, make meaningful connectionsaall without fear threats to their safety well-being. How do teensa rights actually show up on Discord? To illustrate how teensa rights are woven into our warning system, take for example Discordas updated approach to enforcing our Bullying Harassment policy. First, itas helpful to understand that bullying is broken down into a number of different dimensions. One of those includes imminent threats of physical harmafor example, extortion a death threat. For violations of that severity, there are no second chances. Users donat get to do that on Discord. But for non-imminent non-physical threats, Discord has built in more opportunities for teens to get message that bullying isnat allowed. These show up in form of a series of time-outs. Say a teen has been flagged for harassing a useramaybe theyare degrading mocking someone. For their first violation, they would get a notice Discord would remove content. Then second time, theyall get a notice, content will get removed, teen will be placed in aread onlya mode for a set number of hours. If it keeps happening, Discord will apply longer longer time outs. Ultimately if teen doesnat change their behavior continues to engage in harassment sustained bullying, they can receive a yearas suspension. This approach is in contrast to a traditional athree strikes youare outa rule, where most violations, no matter how severe, would count against you, then after three dings, youare banned for good. Discordas more rehabilitative approach takes into account too-real probability that teens are going to make mistakes. aImagine a 14-year-old who falls in with a bad crowd engages in a bunch of bullying gets suspended for a year,a said Cloyd. aIf they return, a 15 year old is going to be a different person in a lot of fundamental ways.a new warning system is also geared toward addressing specific thing a teen did wrong. For example, letas say a teen posts an image that violates Discordas rules. An appropriate measure would be to turn off their ability to post images for a while, but they can still talk to their friends, join voice chats, play games. aWe're taking very targeted interventions not just slamming a big ban hammer down,a said Cloyd. aBecause you posted one wrong image you didn't know was wrong, wead block you out of app forever? That's not fair. That's not a learning experience.a Why do teens need special rights in digital spaces? aWe intuitively recognize that as children get a little bit older, they are autonomous humans. They have agency,a said Hegarty. aThey have right to access online spaces safely.a This goes back to UN document, which Hegarty first encountered before she came to Discord when she worked for a childrenas digital advocacy organization. aThe whole world is fairly new to thinking about how we handle teens in online spaces, especially when more more of their lives are taking place online. It has an impact across everything from telemedicine to education,a said Hegarty. Teens are at a transformative exciting stage of life. They get to explore world in new ways. They use platforms like Discord to find themselves make meaningful connections, but that can't be separated from potential that they'll make mistakes along way. Recognizing thataand helping them grow from itahelps keep everyone safer. Teachable Moments Hidden in Plain Sight Using research to help teens build their 'safety muscle' To do that, Discord works with organizations like Digital Wellness Lab at Boston Childrenas Hospital National PTA to understand needs of one of our largest user bases. aWe are experts in technology, not experts in teenagers. So we need to make sure we are pulling in expert research when we're thinking about what it means to be a safe, healthy ultimately, empowering place for young people,a said Liz Hegarty, Discordas global teen safety policy manager.A A Hegarty her colleagues are guided by research, which is empathetic to teens' lived experiences cautions against being overly paternalistic. For example, Digital Wellness Lab advises parents to resist urge to step in solve every problem for their teen, online off. Instead, they recommend asking probing questions talking through decision-making process. This can clear way to have more conversations about digital boundaries. aThese conversations can help teens build their safety musclea, said Hegarty. We built our Family Center with this idea in mind. Launched in 2023, Family Center is an opt-in tool that enables guardians, trusted adults, teens to alinka their accounts. While it allows parents to know who their teen is connected with, tool does not allow adults to see contents of their teenas conversations with friends. aThe key is to find balance between respecting teen autonomy agency while also giving parents ways to check in with their teensa, said Savannah Badalich, Discordas senior director of policy. aParents trusted adults in a teen's life are here to coach them,a said Badalich, who leads team responsible for key safety areas, such as teen safety mental health. aLet them explore themselves, let them find who they are. But give them parameters in which to do so.a There is a risk that a teen may choose not to talk at all if they feel they are being constantly monitored. This is why it's important to follow research. aLeading experts say that sort of parental surveillance does not always help generate safety create a trustworthy environment for teens to talk to their caregivers,a Hegarty said. Hegarty notes that when building Family Center tool, Discord decided to add an additional layer of support. As a teen connects with their parents, Discord surfaces information for Crisis Text Line (note that this is for users in U.S. only). This is a support line that provides free, 24/7 mental health support via text, WhatsApp, web chat. idea is to provide available resources to teens to encourage them to seek help if they need it. Itas another way we embed subtle lessons throughout experience. Weaving in teachable moments Discordas Teen Safety Assist includes two recently released safety features: one for when a teen receives a direct message (DM) from a user for first time, another that blurs potentially sensitive content in DMs group DMs with friends. When an alert is triggered, teen might see a pop-up that says, Unwanted message? If you donat want to chat with this person, you can block mute them.A They can then click to alearn more,a see a message that prompts aUnwanted message?a, as well as provides a set of tips for handling situation.a a aIt's this idea of educating as opposed to just punishing teenagers when they make mistakes,a said Hegarty. aIn moment, itas important to give teens resources, autonomy, agency, help.a Hegarty points to research about how teens are nervous to block other people. They're worried if person finds out they're blocked, teen is going to look uncool. Meanwhile, if they report, they arenat sure what will happen next. They are anxious about getting somebody in trouble. Research from Thorn, a leading child welfare nonprofit, also suggests that when teens encounter a potentially harmful experience online, they are less likely to seek support offline, such as talking to a trusted adult. So Discord is trying to meet teens where they are. aIt's not a paternalistic approach that protects teens from everything. Being overly restrictive risks them lacking necessary skills to move within world once they turn 18,a said Badalich. aInstead, let's educate them throughout their experience. Let's give them tools to control their experience.a Giving teens opportunities to learn Risk-taking is part of growing up. Itas part of being a teenager. aBecause their brain is still developing, they need options, time education,a said Badalich, whose team is also working to sharpen Discordas enforcement system with teens in mind. When it comes to developing policies rules that govern platform, Badalich her team are rethinking what that looks like, with understanding that teens need extra opportunities to learn. aKeep up, take down, ban have been main levers. we're continuing to explore even more ways to take necessary action,a said Badalich. For example, aWhen you think about someone talking about self-harm, do we really want to penalize them? do we want to figure out some other form of intervention?a To be clear, when it comes to most severe violationsasuch as those involving violent extremism content that sexualizes childrenaDiscord will continue to have a zero-tolerance policy. But when it comes to building out more nuanced, research-driven policies, policy team looks to lessons from restorative justice, a concept that recognizes that people are capable of change. aInstead of just being purely punitive all of time,a said Badalich, aDiscord wants to move in direction of where we are giving people opportunities to change, grow, learn.a Building a Safer Place for Teens to Hang Out Choose what you see who you want to hang with Introducing our new Teen Safety Assist initiative: Teen Safety Assist is focused on further protecting teens by introducing a new series of features, including multiple safety alerts sensitive content filters that will be default enabled for teen users. Starting next week, weare excited to release first two features of Teen Safety Assist initiative. Teens have shared that they like tools that help them avoid unwanted direct messages (DMs) media. To support this, weare rolling out safety alerts on senders sensitive content filters that automatically blur media that may be sensitive a even if sender doesnat initially blur it with a spoiler tag.A a Weave partnered with technology non-profit Thorn to design these features together based on their guidance on teen online safety behaviors what works best to help protect teens. Our partnership has focused on empowering teens to take control over safety how best to guide teens to helpful tips resources. Weare grateful for support of Thorn to ensure we build right protections empower teens with tools resources they need to have a safer online experience. first two features of Teen Safety initiative will start rolling out globally in November 2023 will be turned on by default for teen users. Stay tuned for many more features from this initiative as we look ahead to next year. Work together to keep each other safe We know mistakes happen rules are accidentally broken. Our new Warning System includes multiple touchpoints so users can easily understand rule violations consequences. These touchpoints provide more transparency into Discord interventions, letting users know how their violation may impact their overall account standing gives information for them to do better in future. We built this system so users can learn how to do better in future help keep all hangouts safe.A Some violations are more serious than others, weall take appropriate action depending on severity of violation. For example, we have will continue to have a zero-tolerance policy towards violent extremism content that sexualizes children. Warning System is built based on our teen-centric policies. This is a multi-year, focused effort to invest more deeply holistically into our teen safety efforts. We incorporate teen-centric philosophies in how we enforce our policies, assess risks of new products with Safety by Design, communicate our policies in an age-appropriate manner. For Warning System, this means that we consider how teens are growing, learning, taking age-appropriate risks as they mature, we give them more opportunities to learn from mistakes rather than punish them harshly. Warning System starts rolling out today in select regions. Stay tuned for many more updates to our Warning System in future. a For our server moderators admins, weave recently expanded their safety toolkit with new features that allow them to proactively identify potentially unsafe activity, such as server raids DM spam, take swift actions as needed.A We began rolling these tools in September to Community Servers, now weare rolling them out to all servers. You choose what stays private While you might be an open book with your friends, having your personal business out there for everyone to see can feel a bit weird. Thatas why you get to decide, from server to server, how much you want to share how easy it is to contact you. With Server Profiles, you can adjust to how you present yourself in different spaces, allowing you to be as much of real ayoua as you feel comfortable being in any particular group.A You can also always try turning on Message Requests: a feature that sends any DM from someone new into a separate inbox requires your approval before that user can DM you again. Or, go extra mile turn off DMs entirely from server members unless youave explicitly added them to your friends list. Weave got you PHEW, okaya that was a lot. Thanks for stickina around jamming through our most recent updates with us. Everything you could ever want to know about safety privacy on Discord, even more if youare learning type of person, lives in our Safety Library a check it out for more tips on making Discord safe comfortable for you. a This article was first published on 10/24/2023. Navigating Online Boundaries With Your Teen Weare committed to making Discord a safe place for teens to hang out with their friends online. While theyare doing their thing weare doing our part to keep them safe, sometimes itas hard for parents to know whatas actually going on in their teensa online lives. Teens navigate online world with a level of expertise that is often underestimated by adults in their lives. For parents, it may be a hard lesson to fathomathat their teens know best. But why wouldnat they? Every teen is their own leading expert in their life experiences (as we all are!). But growing up online, this generation is particularly adept at what it means to make new friends, find community, express their authentic selves, test boundariesaall online. But that doesnat mean teens donat need adultsa help when it comes to setting healthy digital boundaries. it doesnat mean parents canat be a guide for cultivating safe, age-appropriate spaces. Itas about finding right balance between giving teens agency while creating right moments to check in with them. One of best ways to do that is to encourage more regular, open honest conversations with your teen about staying safe online. Here at Discord, weave developed tools to help that process, like our Family Center: an opt-in program that makes it easy for parents guardians to be informed about their teenas Discord activity while respecting their autonomy. Here are a few more ways to kick off online safety discussions. If a teen feels like they could get in trouble for something, they wonat be honest with you. So go into these conversations from a place of curiosity first, rather than judgment. Here are a few conversation-starters: Teens will be less likely to share if they feel like parents just donat get it, so asking open questions like these will foster more conversation. Questions rooted in blame can also backfire: teen may not be as forthcoming because they feel like adult is already gearing up to punish them. Read more helpful prompts for talking with your teen about online safety in our Discord Safety Center. Our goal at Discord is to make it a place where teens can talk hang out with their friends in a safe, fun way. Itas a place where teens have power agency, where they get to feel like they own something. Just because your teen is having fun online doesn't mean you have to give up your parental role. Parents trusted adults in a teenas life are here to coach guide them, enabling them to explore themselves find out who they areawhile giving them parameters by which to do so. On Discord, some of those boundaries could include: Using Discordas Family Center feature so you can be more informed involved in your teensa online life without prying. At Discord, weave created several tools to help parents stay informed in touch with their teens online, including this Parentas Guide to Discord Family Center. In spirit of meeting teens where they are, weave also introduced a lighthearted way to spur conversations through a set of digital safety tarot cards. Popular with Gen Z, tarot cards are a fun way for teens to self-reflect find meaning in a world that can feel out of control. messages shown in cards encourage teens to be kind to use their intuition trust their instincts. They remind teens to fire up their empathy, while also reminding them itas OK to block those who bring you down. no, these cards will (unfortunately) not tell you your future! But theyare a fun way to initiate discussions about online safety establish a neutral, welcoming space for your teen to share their concerns. They encourage teens to share real-life experiences stories of online encounters, both positive negative. idea is to get young people talking, parents listening. Sometimes, even as adults, it's easy to get in over your head online. Through our research with parents teens, we found that while 30% of parents said their Gen Zeras emotional mental health had taken a turn for worse in past few years, 55% of Gen Z said it. while some teens acknowledged that being extremely online can contribute to that, more reported that online communications platforms, including social media, play a positive role in their life through providing meaningful community connection. Understanding healthy digital boundaries how they can impact mental wellbeing is important, no matter if youare a teen, parent, any age in-between. When it comes to addressing unique safety needs of each individual, there are resources, such as Crisis Text Line. Trained volunteer Crisis Counselors are available to support anyone in their time of need 24/7. Just text DISCORD to 741741 to receive free confidential mental health support in English Spanish.

A You can learn more about Discordas partnership with Crisis Text line here. You can find more resources about mental health here. What Happens After I Submit a Report? When we become aware of content that violates our Community Guidelines Terms of Service, our Safety team reviews takes necessary enforcement actions, including: disabling accounts, removing servers, when appropriate, engaging with proper authorities. We may not review your report manually respond to you directly, but weall use your report to improve Discord. You can read more about reports we receive actions we take on violations of our Community Guidelines Terms of Service in our quarterly Transparency Report. a Developing Moderator Guidelines Lead by Example moderators are people that your community members look to, not just for enforcement of server rules maintaining peace, but also as role models for what behavior is appropriate for server. If your users see moderators ignoring bending certain rules, they will learn that that is ok for them to do so also, they will call you out if you attempt to hypocritically enforce rules against them. As such, moderators should hold themselves to a higher standard than other users, especially in regards to civility more subjective rules such as what is considered NSFW content. This also applies also for private interactions among mod team. For example, if a moderator is talking in chat shares a suggestive picture, users will understand that other pictures that are equally as suggestive are ok to post. Not only will this encourage borderline rule-breaking behavior, it makes it more difficult for moderators to peacefully moderate NSFW content because users will say aWell, you posted this picture picture I posted is basically same.a same holds true in way moderators respond to questions. If someone asks for help on something moderators respond to them rudely condescendingly others will treat new users same way create a hostile environment. Thatas not to say that moderators canat have fun, of course. Moderators can should participate in chat regularly engage with members as normal users. If a moderator entering chat is disruptive in of itself, it usually means that moderators are not active enough in server. Ultimately, moderators should strive to be seen fondly by server members, yet respected in their positions of authority. Moderators that fail to enforce rules will be seen as unprofessional apushoversa by server members, while moderators that enforce rules too strictly and/or do not participate in chat will be seen as aloof, aggressive, out of touch. Spirit of Rules One of things you may often hear is that aspirit of rulesa is more important than aletter.a In other words, it is more important that people follow intent of rules, rather than adhering to a literal technical definition. As a result, moderators should focus on managing problems of chat, including addressing unhealthy behavior that may not directly break a rule. It is appropriate to moderate people that are deliberately toeing line to see what they can get away with (i.e., trolling), but what many moderator teams also forget is that rules are not infallible, moderators should use their judgment to enforce rules only when it makes sense, not blindly following letter of law. There may be instances where wording specifics of rules end up disallowing behavior that, in practice, does not go against main principle of moderation. In these cases, moderators should refrain from warning user without consulting rest of their mod team also seriously consider modifying rules to more accurately reflect expectations of mod team in regards to server conduct. For example: letas say you have a rule that prevents users from cropping images to focus on sexual body parts in order to prevent NSFW conversations from occurring in chat. However, someone ends up cropping an image of an in game character to focus on her skirt from behind, discussing outfit. In this case, it may not be appropriate to warn user since they are using this image to start an appropriate conversation, even if it technically breaks rule about cropping pictures. So, mod team should discuss ways that rule can be rewritten to cover scenarios like these, rather than resign themselves to warning user abecause rules say so.a Remember: rules exist to serve community, not other way around. Moderators should conduct themselves in accordance with rules, potentially even better, but they ultimately have power to change them for better of server if need be. Treat your rules as a living document remember that they are there to improve your community, not stunt it. When to Forgo Progressive Discipline While certain rules readily offer an ainstant bana option (such as doxxing) in some cases, a useras conduct may reveal that they are only in chat to troll otherwise cause trouble in a way that does not break one of instant ban rules. Just as rules exist to serve community, so too does progressive discipline system. purpose of progressive discipline system is to allow your members to understand their bad behavior rectify it in future without unduly punishing them for occasional small mistakes. Conversely, this means that users that are clearly acting in bad faith on server may not be afforded same leniency should be muted banned depending on circumstances especially if user in question does not have any previously normal chat history. While users that instantly break rules without message history could all be potentially banned, some behavior you may want to consider in particular includes: Itas important that disruptive users be addressed quickly before they sour mood of other server members (which could lead to additional infractions from users that were incited by original bad behavior in first place). Just as moderators should not use rules to punish users that donat practically deserve it, moderators should also be sure not to allow disruptive users to remain on principle of following policy. Other Considerations While principles above are most generally important moderation principles, there may be other things you want to include in your moderator guidelines channel as well such as Always keep in mind any peculiarities of your server questions your moderators might have so that you can proactively address them before they become issues. Summary A moderation guidelines channel is an important channel for helping your moderators get acquainted with both procedural aspects of moderation more subjective aspects. Moderators should be aware that they are leading by example hold themselves to a higher standard so that other users will be encouraged to follow their example. This will help them perform their duties smoothly as well as allow them to readily de-escalate conflicts before they become an issue, encouraging a positive server culture. Finally, by encouraging your moderators to evaluate situations critically, you have mods that can understand both when users should be swiftly punished as well as when rules may need to be adjusted clarified to allow greater flexibility. If youare interested in seeing example moderation guidelines, you can check out link here. Hopefully these help you in developing your own moderation guidelines. Happy moderating! Using XP Systems What Are XP Systems How Do They Work? One of most important factors of keeping a community alive healthy is activity. To maintain activity, moderators can use a few different methods which generally can be separated into two groups: active passive. Active methods are those which require presence active participation of a moderator. Passive methods, on other hand, do not require a constant presence from an individual are often automated by using bots. Keep in mind that even passive methods will require occasional maintenance from a moderator. One of more popular passive methods are XP systems. XP systems, otherwise known as experience leveling systems, grant users experience points (XP) levels based on their activity in a server. Their main purpose is to reward member activity in community. These systems exist in form of bots. Usually they are just one function of multi-purpose bots, but there are cases where sole function of bot is leveling system. basic way these systems work is: These four steps are only a simplification of process, there are many options to consider while using these systems. Depending on bot you choose to use, you can get various options for configuration but there are several that are commonly available on most bots. Some of these options are: Usage of XP Systems main function of XP systems is to reward user activity. Their ability to passively lead users towards being active allows moderators to occasionally take a moment to step back from their usual activities of engaging with their community. existence of a leaderboard appeals to competitive nature of humans pulls them to be more active. Rewards additionally add to this appeal. This is applicable in small, medium some large communities. Alternatively, XP systems can be used as a measure of security. By locking certain permissions behind levels, you can make sure that inactive malicious users are prevented from committing certain offenses. This is mostly applicable in very large servers. Both of these routes will require utilization of roles. There are two main reasons for this: Regulation of Activity As goal of XP systems is to boost activity, it is important to note that they will also lure in users who believe any type of activity is acceptable. This is not case. While problem of spam is already resolved by cooldown ability of most XP systems, there are still behavioral issues that need to be addressed. Members need to be aware that rules still exist in community they cannot simply do as they please. It is important to moderate those who blatantly misbehave in order to level up. Other contributions to community, which are not measured with activity in text voice chat, should also be rewarded, such as artworks, stories, etc. Furthermore, activity that comes from channels which encourage spam-like behavior, such as bot channels, should not count towards total. For that reason, XP gain should be disabled in channels of that sort. Types of XP Systems Knowing that we have ability to reset XP in server, we can use this option to create different types of XP systems. We can divide XP systems into three different types: cyclical, permanent combined. Cyclical systems reset XP points in a regular cycle. Cycle duration should be set based on activity, though it is not advisable to use this system in communities with very low activity. constant resets in leaderboard allow new members to climb charts quickly, but this only lets system be used for rewards. It is common to give out special rewards to most active users at end of cycle, such as custom roles for duration of following cycle, which encourages continued activity to retain their rewards. This also gives moderators opportunity to post announcements regularly at ends of cycles. biggest downside of this system is that not all bots have ability to also remove leveling roles when cycle ends. Permanent systems do not reset at any point in time. Occasionally, users that are banned have left are removed from leaderboards. They give a good look into who most active dedicated users in community are. Permanent systems can be used both for rewards security. Their biggest downside is that they are not very friendly towards new members, especially in older communities. Combined systems are a combination of cyclical permanent systems. They usually require usage of 2 separate bots to keep track of rankings on both leaderboards. They take best aspects of both systems, meaning they can be used both for rewards, which would be connected to cyclical system, security, which would be connected to permanent one. This also allows for cyclical leaderboard to help involve new users more, while still giving good insight of who most active members of all time are with permanent one. only big downside that remains is issue of removing roles from a large number of members. Negative Aspects As with any system, there are several negative aspects to consider when it comes to using XP systems. All of these should be taken into consideration before you make a decision on whether you want to use one. Some of most commonly voiced concerns would be following: fact that these systems encourage sending a larger number of messages automatically leads to idea of spam. Since spam is considered a violation of rules, as well as a ToS violation, this would become a huge problem. issue is easily resolvable, thanks to built in anti-spam measures XP systems have, primarily message cooldown. This, in combination with good moderation would make it certain that no spam is generated by presence of system. Since most XP systems require utilization of roles for truly fulfilling their usage, issue of role bloating comes to mind. It is important to manage space leveled roles properly in order to avoid creating an excessive number of roles with no real use in your server. It is believed that when it comes to rewarding members, rewards should be granted manually through qualitative judgement of content, rather than quantitative. Itas a fact that bots cannot themselves tell quality of messages sent. fact that all types of conversations allow users to gain XP means that there is no meter on what quality of conversation is. Granting privileges as a result of such conversations sends wrong idea of what sort of activity is encouraged. Only humans can truly judge content subjectively to determine quality. By combining proper moderation, for handling judgement of quality, built-in preventive mechanisms of XP systems for quantity control, this issue can be held down to a minimal level. This would be one of most difficult problems of system to resolve. Many members, with intent of increasing their XP count level, will attempt to hold conversation in community. This part of it is perfectly fine. problem arises when they start forcing conversation at any point in time solely to increase their message count. result would be communication that is completely unnatural unhealthy. This type of abuse of system canat really be stopped with cooldown system since most of time it is not spam. only real way to prevent this is to use No XP role, but difficulty of telling organic inorganic communication apart raises question: Was there really any violation of system? Not in every case is an XP system useful for a community. In many cases moderators canat figure out how they can add this sort of system make it seem like a natural part of server, how it can fit theme of community. Considering theme purpose of your server is an important part of making decision of adding a leveling system to your server. Before you make decision, ask yourself: How can I make this system a natural part of my community? Which Bot Do I Use? In following section, several publicly available bots will be presented as options for what you can use for an XP System in your server. following bots have been chosen based on data collected from a survey of various moderators, administrators owners in Discord communities. This list is not exhaustive. There are plenty of alternatives available online. All of listed bots are free public. Some features may be limited to paid additions private versions of bots. content of this article is not endorsed by any bot company related to bots. Gaius Play is an entertainment bot that also hosts an XP system. It takes both text voice chat activity into account. basic version comes with a preset configuration for XP gain leveling, as well as commands for adding rewards up to 6 roles, fully customizing toggling level-up messages, manually controlling XP, ignoring activity in certain channels ability to boost XP gain within certain parameters (roles, channels, time periods). It also has ability to remove leveled roles from all users, making it ideal for use in a cyclical system. Additionally, there are several premium features, such as unlimited reward roles a tree leveling system. Users can also reset their own reward roles in order to change paths on tree leveling system. Amari is a bot that is solely focused on leveling systems. It only looks at activity in text channels. This is a very simple bot, containing commands for setting rewards, manually controlling XP, customizing toggling level-up messages, as well as ignoring activity in some channels. It has ability to have 2 leaderboards active at same time, both of which can be reset at any point. Donor features allow for modification of cooldown between messages, as well as modification of XP gain per message. Nadeko is a multi-purpose bot with a leveling system module. It detects activity exclusively from text chat has a preset configuration for XP gain. It contains commands for setting up reward roles, toggling level-up messages, ignoring activity in channels manually controlling XP. A big upside of this bot is that you have option to host it yourself. This also adds ability to set up in-bot currency rewards, as well as better overall control of bot. Tatsu is another multi-purpose bot with an XP system module. It has several basic commands, allowing creation of reward roles, toggling level-up announcements, modifying XP gain per message cooldown, manual XP control ignoring channel activity. It also features a dashboard a global leaderboard alongside local one. Summary With available selection of bots documentation explaining setup of XP systems, using leveling modules is simpler than ever. configuration options that exist on these modules allow for creative usage of leveling systems with goal of passively increasing activity within community. Naturally, you have to consider several factors prior to deciding on using XP systems. If you are considering using one, think of how you can best integrate it into your community. In which way will you use it? Which type of system would suit your community best? Which bot would be best for task? Of course, there are negative aspects to consider as well, meaning youad have to figure out how to control minimize them. Carefully weigh all pros cons prior to making a final decision. Creating Moderation Team Channels Moderation Channel Setup Once confident in channel permissions that lock access to your private moderation channels, itas important to think about what you want your moderation channels to look like. larger server more channels you may need to accommodate everything. An important rule of thumb is to make sure that your moderation channels are an exception to any auto-moderated actions your moderation bot may be taking, that automoderator is configured not to act on messages from moderators. No blacklists should be in effect in these channels to ensure proper discussion of punishments happenings in server can be discussed truthfully respectfully. Itas also important to ensure that any message logging is configured to ignore channels that not all moderators have access to. For example, if all of your moderators can see a general action log channel, but you have a separate channel for a lead chat, deleted edited messages from that channel should not be logged for privacy reasons. More about this can be found below. Structurally, it is recommended to have informational channels at top of your moderation channel category to make sure everyone sees them. Anything that should be easily viewable by team follows, such as an update channel moderation/action logging based channels. Channels restricted to smaller groups of moderators should be closer to bottom as less people have access to these, partnership channels meant to maintain relations as opposed to direct moderation connections can be on bottom. A sample of a large staff channelset can be found below. a a Weall now begin to outline a variety of channels that are often useful for moderation purposes. below list is for your consideration when building your own moderation channel category, but by no means should you feel obligated to add every channel discussed below to your server. This is all about recognizing your needs making sure they are met! Every moderation team should have a developed moderation handbook that is easily accessible to all team members updated regularly. However, some moderation teams like to have an overview channel for rule enforcement for quick referencing. This channel can contain information such as how you categorize punishments, an overview of popular commands for easy referencing after returning from a moderation break, links to all guidelines moderation forms for easy coordination. We recommend that this channel is viewable to all moderators, but Send Message permissions for informational channels like this should be limited to server owner administrators to ensure only important select information is fed into channel. Additionally, denying Manage Message permissions to everyone but administrators is also recommended to ensure that these informational messages arenat deleted. Action logs are most important moderation channels out there, but also busiest. Moderation action logs exist for a variety of purposes, you can configure them however you see fit. Some recommended actioning channels include, but are not limited to: Like your server, your moderation team can have a general channel. While it is important for your moderators to moderate, itas also important for your team to bond. This is best achieved by having a space that is not dedicated to moderation. It exists to talk to each other, get to know each other, build rapport in your team environment. Moderation can be stressful, this is where you can go to take a break with your teammates. However, it is important to maintain same set of moderation expectations here as you would in public channels. An occasional vent is understood acceptable, but you should avoid speaking negatively of server members that can taint a moderation experience. While itas important to bond with your teammates, it is also important to bond with your server members as well. Chatting in server itself is just as encouraged as getting to know your fellow moderators. If you enable community server option for your server, youall have updates fed to a chosen channel. As these will be major community-based updates for moderation purposes, it is often recommended to have them feed to a moderation update memo based channel for ease of viewing. Channels that serve this purpose can be used for a variety of reasons including announcing extended absences from team for vacations mental health purposes to avoid burnout, taking team-wide votes, making announcements for moderator removals, departures, promotions, initiatives team is pursuing. Many servers use a single channel as a catch-all update arena as it serves a very specific purpose will not be used daily. Although there are a variety of ways to organize your team hierarchy, in addition to regular moderators most mod teams also have administrators who are responsible for overseeing regular moderators. Some mod teams also make a distinction between regular moderators moderators-in-training, who may have different permissions compared to regular moderators otherwise be subject to additional scrutiny during their training period. If these distinctions exist within your own mod team, it may be wise to create separate administrator channels training channels. Administrator Channels - An administrator chat is necessary to speak about private matters on team. This is to judge general moderation performance, handle punishments for problematic actions internally, it also serves as a place to handle any reports against moderators to ensure privacy. Please remember, it is important that these messages are not caught up in bot logging so moderators are not made aware of fact that they are being discussed privately before leads connect with them. Training Channels - General permissions granted to all moderators will not yet be accessible to moderator trainees, thus some teams consider locking their access to select channels. There will need to be a space for all moderators leads to privately discuss growth of trainees without them gaining access even after promotion. Some teams may go as far as to establish a unique action log channel used during training periods before giving them access to full history of moderation team once they prove their ability to be unbiased moderators. Again, it is important to ensure that discussion channels for trainees are exceptions to basic bot logging to avoid awkward occurrences with trainees seeing commentary about them that they should not see yet. There are a plethora of moderation channels that can benefit a team in unique circumstances that donat fit into above categories. Consider following when thinking about what fits best for how your community is run: If your community is linked to an external community such as Reddit Twitch, it would be useful to have separate moderation channels dedicated to this external community in addition to your Discord moderation channels. Reddit moderation channels specifically can be created by utilizing webhooks. Reddit moderation spaces housed on Discord often have r/modnews updates feeding into a special update area channel sets unique to their external community needs. You can also have new posts comments logged into a designated Reddit action log for easy reference without opening Reddit. Teams that have a separate Reddit Twitch moderation team in addition to their Discord moderation team may have designated hangout spaces for all teams to get to know each other casually. But, most importantly, they may have shared moderation spaces to discuss troublemakers that can span multiple platforms to flag problematic users for other team. Easy specialized communication across teams will help to keep all facets of your community safe! Conclusion There is no right wrong way to set up a moderation channel category outside of ensuring you utilize correct permissions. Itas important to consider needs of your community how their needs translate to needs of your team when creating your moderation space. Having flexibility a willingness to grow as your server grows requires change is imperative. While action logs are most useful kind of moderation channels from a punishment perspective, hangout spaces are important to establishing team cohesion rapport. Identifying needs of your team making sure they are adequately met will help you create strongest moderation environment as possible. Schools X Discord Benefits of Using Discord in Classrooms Lots of new opportunities are created for schools who make use of a private Discord server. One of biggest opportunities is presented in a cultural shift away from formality closer to general bonding. Gone are days of formal communications over e-mail instead we have open chat discussions with teachers, fellow classmates, group project members, even private one-on-oneas (similar to office hours!) when necessary. In this section we seek to discuss many ways that Discord can help virtual learning. Discord can function as a virtual classroom setting in ways that can generate new opportunities for continued reliable teamwork while enabling new exciting ways for students to connect with each other. Utilizing Discord as a Virtual Classroom While certain permissions are essential to creating an environment that separates teachers student private chats subjects, a classroom environment acts as overall hub for everything necessary from a full school, to a specific classroom, to separate groups working on projects, even a variation of subjects being taught. Simultaneously, a server can be set up to serve a variety of school-related functions including, but not limited to: Discord naturally lends itself to communication in ways that allow students to help each other. If one student is stuck on an assignment, any student can answer their question perhaps join them in a study session to work out problem together. Schoolwork can feel less solitary, there is less of a reliance on teachers aids, students who may be taking same subject in different classes can meet each other help each other out. This also allows teachers to monitor such a space to gain insight as to where their students are struggling so they can adjust their lesson plans accordingly. Interaction with each other doesnat have to be limited to just typing in designated channels. Students can interact with each other teachers while using subject specific audio and/or video channels as well, allowing them to have more personal interactions cater to different learning styles. However, if you are using these channels to broadcast a lesson not promote group work, make sure that you disable voice activity for students to avoid accidental noise from being broadcasted throughout your online classroom. This helps create a controlled environment for all involved in virtual classroom space. An example about how to do this is below. Discordas Easy to Use Interface Will Make Students Feel at Home Discord was created for housing online communities which sets it apart from other routes taken for e-learning platforms. Your students staff will feel at home in Discord user interface because it is easy to use made for quick adaptation. natural familiarity that many students may bring from their personal usage of platform even other similar platforms will reduce friction of adopting into new virtual learning atmospheres more easily help transition Discord into their daily educational routines. A common complaint in larger classroom settings, both in person virtually, is that environment is impersonal. In a sea of many faces, it is understandable that a student may feel like just another number on attendance roster. However, Discordas premise of providing an easily built space meant for easy informal communication can reduce this lack of personal connection instead help students feel welcome, including, easily engaged. a There is Always Fun to be Had in a Healthy Community When creating your virtual classroom it is important to keep in mind what you want purpose of your server to be. A server for a specific math classroom taught by Mr. Wumpus at noon everyday is going to be geared entirely towards education, whereas a more open-concept Algebra server that welcomes all students currently enrolled in course under various teachers to have a more common meeting space while also being split into their respective virtual classrooms via permissions allows for antics in addition to education. Educational settings can also be fun if you choose to build them that way. There is always fun to be had in a healthy community when school day finishes, providing this hang out space for students will allow them to not only bond but associate positive feelings with school. There can be spaces designated to help students study together in after school hours perhaps come together to take a study break to play one of their favorite games. A music bot can be used to listen to music in an essay-writing sprint, a leveling system can be used to reward students for participation. Community feelings lead to happiness, which can impact mental health grading. Discord is an Extension of your Physical Campus Discord also brings many advantages to educational arenas outside of classroom. A server can be viewed as an extension of your physical campus to Internet in an e-learning environment. Similar to a real-life campus, Discord is a meeting place for students staff to chat, get to know each other, build a stronger community in places they feel safe. Shy students may even find it easier to bond better in an online environment than a physical one which can lead to generating new friendships while also improving pre-existing ones. Students who perceive a welcoming environment have positive feelings about their school community will often get better grades because of higher motivations levels. Interestingly, a further extension of a physical campus would be to an alumni association. While school related Discord servers are often for study tools virtual classrooms, they can also serve as special places for alumni to connect after graduation. They can not only catch up with their old classmates, but they can mentor current students as well. Such a situation can be brought about via unique ideas like career fairs oriented towards advising current students about future career options by making use of a schoolsa alumni network. Disadvantages of Using Discord as a School Platform As mentioned above, Discordas widespread usage for personal gaming easy to use interface means that a lot of students could already use Discord in their free time begin to adopt it into their lives after being introduced to it in a classroom setting. person someone may present themselves as online can differ from who they are in real life. When given opportunity to use a profile picture, set usernames nicknames, even statuses, things can get out of hand quickly. It may even be difficult for some teachers to identify which student is behind certain accounts if these expectations arenat established immediately upon server creation. With likely change that a student might not want to use a picture of themself as their profile picture, it is important to establish server guidelines about what is appropriate to be in that photo. While some users may not be comfortable using their full name even their first name in their username, set expectation that everyone has to change their nickname in your private school-related Discord servers to their real name. On a related note, if a user is subscribed to Discord Nitro, they may also change their profile picture on an individual server basis. However, it's not required in order to use Discord on whole. Our recommendation if a student is uncomfortable with using their real picture for their platform-wide account is to tell them to make a secondary account specifically for school where they can use a photo of themselves. With Discord's account switcher feature having a second account for this purpose is less of hassle. Finally, when students first enter server, we recommend enabling Developer Mode to privately connect each individual User ID to a student should someone alter change their identity/account information in future. This could be done through schools information management system, just by using a spreadsheet. It is also imperative to reiterate boundary that you expect everything present in virtual school ecosystem to be school appropriate. Features like profile pictures, username, status are platform-wide features that appear in all servers a user is in. What is appropriate in some spaces may not be appropriate in school. Consider this ahead of time to establish rules around this also punishments should this not be respected. It is important to keep in mind that Discord does have strict Terms of Service Community Guidelines that state users arenat allowed to use NSFW content other forms of illegal content as their username, profile picture, and/or status. This will partly make sure content on their profiles is acceptable to a degree. However, you may not be comfortable if a student is cursing in your virtual classroom that can be dealt with accordingly by you. Conclusion Discordas very purpose is to foster communication by bringing users an easy to understand interface that is adaptable to a variety of needs, thus making it a really useful modern tool for e-learning virtual classrooms. With right permissions, students can be brought into environments where they can not only learn, but also have fun in a virtual extension of their physical campus. Through utilization of a variety of ways to teach classrooms communicate amongst groups, Discord naturally fosters teamwork open forum discussions between students teachers alike. However, Discord is still a platform with millions of users exploring a variety of interests. Itas important to enter Discord prepared to handle students who may be using inappropriate media for school via platform-wide features like profile pictures, statues, usernames because they are appropriate elsewhere. If you consider logistics of creating a safe, school-appropriate environment set expectations guidelines upon entry, Discord is a great tool for your future educational needs! Confidentiality in Moderation Considerations Regarding Leadership Whichever moderation roles a server may have, there should always be an authority role that can make calls at their discretion if they believe it is best thing for community. A good example on how to do just that can be found here. Moderation administrators, leaders, managers, etc. should always be prepared ready to make judgment calls on information provided to them, whether by mods users. A very common misconception among moderation teams is that they should share all information amongst team for transparency. This can be a double-edged sword in sense that disclosing private information that is not essential for a moderator can open more routes for that information to have unauthorized distribution. If this occurs, it will compromise privacy trust of users that information applies to. In sensitive situations containing very volatile information, consider if it may be beneficial to have it handled directly by a team leader even owner of community. Personally identifiable information (or PII) is any information that can identify a user, such as an email address, full name, phone number, IP address, exact location, even their Discord user ID username. People should never disclose someoneas personal information except their own in an appropriate environment, as disclosing othersa info can be treated as doxxing, which is a disclosure of personal info by a third party (for example, someone posting another useras address), can, in some instances, be actioned on by Trust Safety as it may violate Discordas Terms of Service/Community Guidelines. User IDs usernames are acceptable as long as there is a justifiable need to disclose it, but make sure to always consider if there may be repercussions to that user if disclosed in any instance. PII is very sensitive as it removes a useras privacy can result in them being targeted online even in real life. Thus, this information should always be protected with utmost discretion. Moderators may come in contact with this in ways such as a message they have to delete, someone maliciously doxxing another person, a user accidentally sharing it without realizing harm they are putting themselves in even from information included in a report. This information typically should not be disclosed to anyone community leaders should consider removing it from bot logging channels to protect a useras identity. Also consider encouraging members of your community to learn how to safeguard their own information. You can include rules within your communities that discourage sharing of even oneas own personal information. As important as it is to protect other users, it is just as important to help them protect themselves. Users may sometimes share their information out of good will as a way of attempting to bond with others, but bad actors can use that information maliciously. Personal matters can refer to a huge range of information, but some common examples can include relationships, interpersonal conflicts, previous history, things as simple as a DM private conversation. As a moderator you may very likely come across information involving this as part of reports, concerns, even someone breaching trust by screenshotting sharing private messages. This information is extremely important to protect as people may trust you to keep it private use it only to take care of issue at hand. Exposures of this information can be very harmful to people can result in targeted harassment, bullying, even further negative consequences. Stories of this can cause people to be concerned even worried about reporting something for fear of it happening to them. In end, this makes things very difficult for moderators to not only reassure, but to rectify. Most public communities have ways of protecting their server with moderation tools, actions, procedures. This includes moderator actions such as warnings, kicks, mutes, bans, etc. Moderation actions may be especially important when it involves a specific user. A Moderation info can even include internal details such as protocol, procedure, censor lists, even bot details. Moderation information is something that can vary from server to server, thus it is relatively up to discretion of each moderation team to instill their own server rules to enforce. Some may have full transparency with an open log channel, some may take a more confidential approach only speak with those involved. Both have their pros cons, but be sure to weigh what could happen if people know who receives what penalties. For protocol, always remember to carefully decide what to share publicly, as disclosing a procedure can lead to someone using that information to evade moderators even exploit server. This also stands true with bots, as disclosing bot details such as configuration censor list can result in users evading protections put in place by your team. a There are many different forms of information that must be considered heavily before disclosing to different people, whether they be users other mods. Information can range from sensitive personal information such as emails, names, phone numbers, location, IP address, etc. to community-related information such as mod actions, previous incidents, user history. Regarding users, very little should be shared to people who are not involved. When it comes to fellow mods, it is always best to share as much information as is reasonable aside from personal information to ensure everyone has a well-informed mindset. Some questions to consider when speaking with users include: Now for mods members of more internal team on servers, mods should of course be ain loopa to know story of a situation, itas never recommended to keep mod teams in dark. That being said, even with other moderators, be careful about sharing unnecessary information, especially personally-identifying information, not only because there is often little benefit to it, but primarily because it compromises a useras privacy even if behind closed doors. A While there are fewer factors to consider, they are still just as important as ones you would ask for another user. Some things to consider when disclosing to moderators include: Remember that if you arenat sure if you should disclose something related to moderation, always ask an administrator/leader on your server for guidance, always dispose of private information if it is not needed. Benefits of Confidentiality It may be easier to be fully transparent not have to check every sentence before it is said sent. That being said, there are many benefits to upholding a consistent, confidential environment where staff act with discretion when assisting with a variety of matters. There are many consequences if confidentiality is not upheld properly. Below are some examples of benefits of protecting information as well as consequences that can come with being overly transparent. Keeping Pseudonymous. As stated by Discordas Safety Principles, Discord is pseudonymous, which means that your account on Discord doesnat need to be tied back to your identity. A Protecting users who may provide information as evidence otherwise may sometimes expose who they are, protecting this information reassures that their personal life wonat be compromised by socializing confiding in a serveras staff. Trust. Users will know of hold high trust within a staff team if they are confident that high expectations of privacy will be respected by team they confide in. If not upheld, users will find it difficult to trust team, may heavily contemplate even refrain contacting a moderation team again in future. User Safety. Diligent protection of user data information helps protect users as it prevents unwanted data from getting into wrong hands. If information is not guarded, information that gets into wrong hands can result in targeted harassment bullying, as many private details can reveal information to malicious individuals. Moderator Safety. Keeping moderation actions confidential only disclosing information to people who need to know helps to keep moderator anonymity reinforces idea of a team decision. Disclosing moderation actions who performed them can put a target on mod, as people may treat them personally responsible for an action may result in harassment disrespect from users who may not understand decision. Personally identifiable information being shared outside of need to know groups can result in compromising users making them feel as if they may need to sacrifice their Discord to retain personal privacy. This leads to a loss of trust from member, perhaps even loss of them as a member of your community. Designing Server for Privacy There are multiple things to be mindful of when considering privacy confidentiality, it extends well beyond standard moderation. Often, privacy will fall down to way that server is configured. Some things to consider include: Server Discoverability. If an LGBTQ+ server is in Server Discovery, a user may use an emote from that server in another one, if someone clicks on emote, it may accidentally expose user as they may identify as LGBTQ+ privately but not publicly. Public Join Messages. Some servers may have awelcome botsa even Discordas welcome feature that greets new users publicly upon joining. Server staff should take into account type of community that they stand for, consider if users may perhaps feel uncomfortable exposed by being mentioned immediately upon joining. Security. Automated security agatekeeper botsa may be used to prevent malicious users from joining a server on alt accounts as part of malicious groups. While this seems perfectly normal, part that has to be considered is what data you are requesting. Some of these bots may collect IP addresses, browser data, various other forms of information. Users may not be comfortable in supplying information that could compromise who they are. Always make sure to read through privacy statement of any bot that you add to ensure that you are not asking for too much information from regular members. Bot Logging. Many servers have private log channels maintained by one more bots. This tracks joins, leaves, deleted edited messages, even more. There are two main points to be wary of with these: if personal information is posted for any reason, be it accidentally by misclick maliciously to dox a user, it will usually appear in a moderator logging channel when deleted. After situation has been dealt with, owners admins should consider deleting log message to prevent personal information from persisting within that channel. Keeping Balance There are pros cons to any level of disclosure that is offered by a server to its community its staff. It is not black white there are gray areas in both transparency revealing select information with moderator discretion. There must always be a balance of both that may shift depending on situation at hand type of community that is present. Just as complete confidentiality will lead to distrust, total transparency will lead to users feeling unprotected due to a lack of privacy. Ban Evasion Advanced Harassment Understanding High Conflict Persons (HCPs) vast majority of community members are interested willing to participate according to platform rules, even if they might not agree with every one of them. Sometimes people break rules disagree, but their behavior can be quickly corrected they can learn from their mistakes. If users continue to break rules, they may be given longer-term even permanent bans from community platform. Most users will accept their ban, but a small fraction will not. A 2018 study by Stanford University estimated that 1% of subreddit communities on Reddit initiate 74% of all conflict on platform. This incredibly small percentage of users rank extremely low in agreeableness personality trait, have no interest in getting along with others. Only a trained clinical psychologist can diagnose a patient with a disorder, but a term commonly used prior to diagnosis is HCP (high-conflict people). There are four primary characteristics of high conflict personalities, which is not a diagnosis but their description of specific conflict behavior: If you fail to use tact in your moderation technique communication approaches, you may find that you your community become target of a high-conflict person. They may spam your community you may delete their posts ban their accounts, but more accounts can be created. Discord uses IP bans to prevent users from creating new accounts, but VPNs can be used to circumvent these bans. If truly motivated, armies of bot accounts can be created used for mass-spamming, members of your community can be doxed, ISPs platforms can be DDoSad to create fear in your community. If a high-conflict person gains access to money, they can pay somebody else to do work for them. Most moderators choose to simply wait out harassment. Advanced harassment like this may go on for several days, even weeks, but then stop abruptly as individual turns their attention to something new in their life. In some cases harassment can go on for months, continuing to escalate in new ways that may put lives of your team community members in danger. What can you do to protect your community from High Conflict Persons? What motivates a person to behave like this? This article will help to explain motivations behind this persistent, destructive behavior, provide actionable steps to reduce resolve their harassment. Virtue of Battling a Nemesis A anemesisa is an enemy rival that pursues you relentlessly in search for vengeance. A nemesis typically holds some degree of fascination for a protagonist, vice versa. Theyare an antagonist whoas bent on revenge, who doesnat go away, who seems to haunt mind of protagonist. Theyave moved past being an enemy to become something much more personal. You might assume that a high-conflict person harassing your community is your nemesis, but this would be incorrect. Youare not going out of your way to obstruct their behavior, your primary focus is to engage moderate your community. If harassment stopped, you would move on forget about their behavior. You resist their behavior only as long as it falls under your realm of influence. In their mind, you have become their nemesis, you must be punished for your insolence. To them, you are Architect of an oppressive Matrix, President Snow of an authoritarian Hunger Games, tyrannical Norsefire government in V for Vendetta. You your community represent opposite of what they believe. In one way another, either by your direct actions through your association with your community, you have wronged them deserve to suffer for your behavior. Itas clear that you will never learn understand what they see. You not only participate in creating corrupt unjust system that they are oppressed by fight against, but as a moderator, you are very lynchpin that maintains corrupt system. You may believe this sounds outlandish, you would be correct. Most people donat believe that world is out to get them, that theyall be hunted down persecuted for what they believe. These individuals have an overactive threat detection system that makes them believe that you your community are actively plotting their downfall. They take your opposing stance as a direct challenge to their competence, authority autonomy. They harass you your community because they believe that youare out to get them, want to replace them their way of life. truth is, all you really want them to do is follow rules maintain a civil conversation. Understanding Tactical Empathy Now that you have a better understanding of how somebody like this thinks, weall discuss strategies that you can employ to solve this problem. goal is NOT to get them to seek help change their mind- we arenat attempting to solve people. Instead, our goal is to prevent stop certain negative behaviors that keep happening so that you can protect your community focus your energy elsewhere. key to getting an individual like this to change their behavior is through utilizing atactical empathya. Tactical empathy is use of emotional intelligence empathy to influence anotheras behavior establish a deal relationship. It is not agreeing with them, but just grasping recognizing their emotions positions. This recognition allows us to act appropriately in order to respond to our counterpartas position in a proactive deliberate manner. premise behind tactical empathy is that no meaningful dialogue takes place when we are not trusted we are perceived as a threat. In order to get someone to stop harassing your community, you need to shift yourself from being villain of their story to being just another random person in their lives. You must work to shatter persona that they have projected onto you show that you are not enemy working to destroy them. Youare just a mod trying to keep your community safe. By demonstrating that you understand respect them as an individual, this will disarm them allow them to focus their energy elsewhere. It will not change their opinion, but at least their behavior will change. A Modas Guide to Situation Diffusal When somebody continues to harass disrupt your community, theyare essentially holding your community hostage. If someone truly is holding your community ahostagea, theyare often doing so because theyare looking to open a dialogue for negotiation. Frequently, people take hostages because they need somebody to listen. They arenat getting attention that they believe they deserve, attempt to cause as much disruption as possible in order to make their case. You are a community moderator negotiating peace of your community, not their lives, but these tactics can still apply. Situation diffusal can generally be defined by three primary processes, each designed to collect information use it to disarm high-conflict person from believing that youare an enemy threat. These processes are called Accusations Audit, Mirroring to Understand Getting to aThatas Righta. An accusations audit is where you focus not on just things that they believe, but things that they believe you did wrong. An accusation Audit is not based on logic - itas based on unfiltered emotions of other person. Itas important that you go through their early comments messages to understand what prompted this behavior in first place. This might have been banning them for breaking a rule not properly punishing another community member that they got into an argument with. They might believe aI feel like you didnat give me a chance to explain myselfa aI feel like youare discriminating against mea. Your understanding of their beliefs will be flawed inaccurate, but you must do your best to piece it together into a coherent argument on their behalf. If possible, learn more about other communities theyare a part of. Identify if theyare harassing any other communities, reasons for doing so. Are there any commonalities of note? Once you believe youave figured out why theyare upset with you your community, mirror their language to verify it. At this point, opening a dialogue might be incredibly difficult if theyare using throwaway accounts regularly. Chances are they do have a primary account they continue to use in other communities, which can help greatly with starting your dialogue. At this stage, youare still working to collect information about what they believe, directly from source. Examples of questions you can use to verify their opinions include, aIt seems like you believe that Iam being unfair because I didnat give you a chance to explain yourself.a aIf I understand correctly, you believe Iave been discriminating against you instead of taking your opinion seriously, is that right?a Chances are, responses you receive will be filled with aggression, profanity insults. You must ignore all of this, continue working to understand their position events that resulted in them targeting your community. Negotiations like this are difficult in voice-to-voice communication, nearly impossible via instant private messaging. They will be incredibly resistant at first, perhaps thinking that youare attempting to trick them into a perjury trap for them to admit their guilt ignorance. When you get them talking to you, mirror that language to get them to elaborate further on their beliefs. An example of dialogue might go something like following: Spammer: aItas bullshit that mods ban strawberry jam lovers because blueberry jam lovers are afraid of being exposed for who they really are.a Mod: aAfraid of being exposed?a Spammer: aYeah, blueberry jam lovers are secretly running world plotting against anyone who doesnat believe in same jam flavor preferences as they do.a Realistically, blueberry jam lovers are not actually running world plotting anything nefarious, but in mind of spammer this is undeniably true. while this example was intentionally mild, you can infer more severe types of conversations that would follow a similar format. Regardless, as you dig further into what they believe, youall notice that rabbit hole will go very deep be filled with logical fallacies obviously disprovable biases that make no sense. Remember that truth reality behind what they believe is completely irrelevant, attempts to correct them will undermine your goals. Your job is to help them explain their beliefs to you to best of their ability, for you to understand their position to best of your ability. Once you believe youave collected enough information, you can move to final step, getting to aThatas Right.a Once you believe youave completely understood their position what they believe, you can repeat their entire position back to them. Demonstrate your understanding by effectively summarizing it concisely accurately, regardless of how much you disagree with position. Donat focus on their behavior actions that resulted in them getting banned. Instead, focus exclusively on ideology that drove their behavior. Do this until youare able to get them to say aYes, thatas righta at least 3 times, by asking if thereas anything else that you forgot in your summary. If you did miss anything, repeat entire position again while including extra information. When reiterating their points, be very careful about restating things that are not true. Do your best to remove personal bias from statements to focus them back to aabsolute truths.a Their actions are about trying to make a point- but what youare doing is getting them to make their point without taking action, because you have heard what they are trying to say. If you do this well enough, if you put enough effort into doing this correctly (and it doesnat need to be perfect), they will know that you finally understand where theyare coming from that theyave been heard by you, their opinion has been validated. By demonstrating you understand their position, you go from being part of problem to being a real person. They might not like you, but they will at least (if begrudgingly so) respect you. When you successfully reach this state of your discussion, itas essential that you be careful with your choice of words. Thereas a good chance that spammer will leave your community alone now that they know that their opinion has been recognized. At very least, you should see an immediate reduction in number of times they attempt to cause harm. If they do continue to harass you your community, itas possible that you failed to address primary reason that theyare upset. Open dialogue with them again follow steps above from beginning, check to see that you havenat fallen into a common pitfall mistake. Common Pitfalls Mistakes Below is a list of common examples of mistakes people make during negotiations: When using tactical empathy, remember that purpose of exercise is to bring their beliefs to conscious mind demonstrate agreement. If you attempt to tell them what they should believe, you may instead get a ayouare righta fail to see any change. difference is subtle, but important. Make sure that other side actually feels heard, that youave fully understood their position. Donat Try to Correct their Opinion As a reminder: do not attempt to correct modify their opinion. Remember purpose of this process. It is not to modify their position opinion, itas only to mirror their opinion to stop identifying you your community as a threat. methodology outlined in this article is designed for conversations in real-life, especially over phone. Itas unlikely that youall be able to get spammer on an audio call, so itas essential to be patient with process careful with your wording. Formal grammar like punctuation can make a sentence feel more serious threatening. Use casual phrasing make an occasional spelling mistake to show youare human. If youare uncertain about tone, read sentence out loud while sounding as angry as you can, adjust accordingly. process outlined here can be easily undermined by others who arenat involved in process. If youare working to negotiate with a spammer but another moderator is threatening them in a different conversation, you wonat see any changes in their behavior. Communicate with your team on strategy you plan to use, remember to ask for emotional support step away if it becomes too taxing. Can High-Conflict People be Helped? There will be some of you who believe that after getting this far, you may be on path to rehabilitating a person like this. mistake is believing that you are further along than you really are, that youare qualified to help someone struggling to control their emotions. truth is, getting to athatas righta is only 1% of process. Even if youare a clinical psychologist, you wouldnat be getting paid for your work, at least not this work. Attempting to provide support via text chat will have diminishing returns. Attempting to show somebody like this aerror of their waysa may result in all of work you have done being reversed. Instead, you must focus on people who want your help who need it- this being people in your community. Empower people who are truly deserving of your time energy. At end of day, youare a human a moderator. Your primary focus in this realm is to make sure your community is safe stays safe- if youave managed to get persistent spammer to stop then youave accomplished what it is youave aimed to do. Facilitating Positive Environments Introduction core foundation of a server on Discord is community that populates it. Your community is what you engage with, protect, grow over time. Engagement is important to focus on, but itas just as important to make sure you are facilitating positive welcoming engagement. Why Positive Environments are Important Positive engagement can mean a lot of things, but in this article, we will be referring to way in which moderation can affect culture of server you are moderating. As moderators your policies, knowledge of your community, deductive skills influence way in which your community engages with each other with your team. When you establish nurture your community, you are growing a collective group of people who all enjoy at least some of same things. Regardless of your server topic, you are undoubtedly going to have members across different a variety of ethnicities, sexual orientations, identities from across world. Ensuring that your space on Discord is a space for them to belong necessitates making it safe for them to feel like they can be themselves, wholly, without reservation. Your members are all humans, all community members, all people that deserve respect deserve to be welcomed. Establishing Community Boundaries in Moderation When you are establishing your community, itas important to have a basic understanding of what kind of environment you would like your server to be. Itas good to break down general moderation philosophy on what content discussion youad like your community to engage in what content would be inappropriate given space. Depending on topic of your server these goals may be different, but some common questions you can ask to establish general boundaries are: Moderating Hateful Content When it comes to content you allow moderate in your server, itas important to, again, reflect on what type of community you are. Itas also important that you act quickly precisely on this type of harmful behavior. Some users will slowly push boundaries on what type of language they can aget away witha before being moderated. When discussing moderation, a popular theory that circulates is called broken windows theory. This theory expresses that if there are signs of antisocial behavior, civil unrest disorder, as well as visible signs of crimes in area, that it encourages further anti-social behavior crime. Similarly, if you create an environment in which toxic hateful behavior is common, cycle will perpetuate into further toxicity hatefulness. What is Bad-Faith Content vs. Good-Faith Content? aBad-faitha content is a term that describes behavior done intentionally to cause mischief, drama, A toxicity to a community. They are also commonly referred to as bad actors, are type of people that should be swiftly dealt with addressed directly. aGood-faitha content is a term that describes user behavior with good intentions. When users are a positive foundation in your community, members that join interact with established community will grow to adapt speak in a way that continues positive environment that has been fostered established. Itas important to note that while agood-faitha users are generally positive people, it is possible for them to state wrong sometimes even harmful words. importance of this distinction is that these users can be educated from their mistakes adapt to behavior you expect of them. When users toe line, they are not acting within good faith. As moderators, you should be directly involved enough to determine what is bad-faith content remove it. On other hand, education is important in community sphere for long term growth. While you can focus on removing bad behavior from bad-faith users, reform in good-faith community members who are uneducated in harmful rhetoric should also be a primary goal when crafting your community. When interacting in your community, if you see harmful rhetoric a harmful stereotype, step back meaningfully think about implications of leaving content up in channels that use this kind of language. Does it: Ideas to Help Prioritize Inclusivity A core way to handle all de-escalation stands in your approach. Users, when heated up during a frustrating toxic discussion, are easy to set off to accidentally escalate to more toxicity. key is to type calmly, to make sure with whatever manner you approach someone to de-escalate, you do it in a way that is understood to be for benefit of everyone involved. Closing Creating a healthy community that leaves a lasting, positive impact in its members is difficult. Moderators have to be aware, educated, always on lookout for things they can improve on. By taking initiative on this front, your community can grow into a positive, welcoming place for all people, regardless of their race, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation. Fundamentals of Family-Friendly Servers How Family-Friendly Servers Differ From Other Servers Because you are dealing with young people, family-friendly servers may become what many refer to as Home Servers. These are online communities that are perceived to be safe spaces that people come back to time again, like a home. Thus, such servers may attract users for different purposes than a community meant for college students might, for example. moderators of family-friendly servers can be viewed as both authoritative figures but also older siblings friends that may be looked up to by their community in unique parasocial relationships. They will also have unique experience of seeing many of their young users mature grow along with server. When forming this kind of environment, itas important to make sure your moderators are naturally empathetic to unique situations that will arise within member reports as a result of interpersonal relationships amongst younger users. During foundational stages of server building make sure to keep ideas such as privacy concerns, text filters, appropriate topics of discussions, rule continuity at forefront of your mind. Consider how you will handle users who are above traditional age range of family-friendly servers who may not wish to abide by these rules. While privacy concerns exist on any platform, they are something to be especially aware of when moderating family-friendly spaces. Rules that cover privacy internet safety may be more strictly enforced to protect younger server members from any harmful actors looking to take advantage of less experienced internet users. Oftentimes, these concerns can culminate in a blanket rule stating that sharing any personally identifying information in server is not allowed. This goes beyond exact locations can include full names, ages, even face reveals. Revealing exact locations full names are generally frowned upon in most online communities because they can be used to find more information about a potential doxxing target. Forbidding users to share their age is an added level of privacy to protect younger members seeking community on Internet from being taken advantage of by those with malicious intentions. Younger users may not understand how risky age differences can be to navigate. Face reveals can be reverse-image searched to further learn information about users who arenat protecting their online privacy, even be stolen used in various forms of bullying. As a result, many family-friendly servers find it best to limit all personally identifying information outside of first name country if users arenat choosing to utilize an online persona to protect themselves. As moderators itas important to help educate young users about how to maintain confidentiality use discretion when revealing personal information. This starts with recognizing not clicking malicious links steers into conversations about reporting things that make them uncomfortable in any way protecting their private information. Keep an eye out on how others interact with younger users act accordingly, as a victim may not realize they are a victim in some situations. Text filter implementation determining which topics of discussion are appropriate for server may be more strict than average community as a result of building a safe space for younger users. There is generally no room for crudeness in any form. A This goes beyond using text filters to monitor hate speech, which is against Discordas Community Guidelines, going further to include curse words, innuendo, illegal substances activities, gore, dark humor making light of serious situations, any negative harmful rhetoric from within fandom your community supports, more. Be sure to adapt your text filters as new situations filter evasions arise within your community. It is often recommended to keep your blacklist private to avoid exposing harmful terminology to users. Additionally, make sure your text filters mirror topics of discussion you arenat allowing in your server clearly outline those preferences in your server rules by noting that your environment is strictly SFW any NSFW content is not allowed. Automoderation can be utilized to mute ban users who are engaging in problematic discussion around hate speech, moderators can use their judgment on other blacklisted words as long as your moderation bot is set to log filtered words in moderation channels. As mentioned in previous section, rule continuity is a big deal in spaces meant for young people to ensure equal enforcement across everything. If youare looking to filter certain content, it should also not be allowed to discuss that topic in your server. This goes for both general chatting for various other forms of server usage, any place where there can be user generated content. One such example is meme art channels. While itas a great idea to foster encourage a healthy positive artistic environment, content that is NSFW, hate speech politically motivated, creations that may lean into age-restricted content like alcohol consumption gore should be monitored discouraged. If you have an active music channel setup, it might be worth keeping an eye on playlists to make sure content being monitored elsewhere doesnat slip by here. With release of server avatars, it is less likely that rule-breaking content can find its way into your server via this route, but consider moderating statuses of active users, user profiles, profile pictures if it does. It also helps to have your moderators lead by example follow same rules in their profiles that you are looking to enforce elsewhere. Continuity is key for equal unbiased rule enforcement. Considerations for Users Above Your Target Age Range While family-friendly environments exist to be safe spaces for young people you may find yourself also having users who are above your target age range. Their presence should not be discouraged, but itas important to ensure that your rules welcome messaging clearly defines your space as family-friendly so that they are aware of expectations for ANY user who joins server. Most will likely be accepting of rules youave put in place space you are trying to cultivate. However, others may naturally challenge certain restrictions that they find childish assume donat apply to them. Establishing language around why your community is meant to be family-friendly importance of keeping it safe for everyone as a result, will be helpful if these conversations arise. Users who may rebel against rules that they do not agree with should be actioned accordingly. If you notice a large portion of your userbase seeking out your community but growing frustrated with its family-friendly restrictions, you can consider opening locked channels for mature users that can either opt-in to their existence show proof of their age. If you decide to do this, make sure you have a separate set of rules in place for these channels, as well as an identification vetting process to make sure that younger users do not get exposed to content you donat want them to be exposed to. This would require moderation that is different from rest of your server, so itas important to consider whether not your moderation team can handle this locked channel if you feel it aligns with your serversa purpose. To Recap Family-friendly communities exist to welcome Discordas youngest users into safe spaces with protection of moderation teams. Home Servers are SFW communities that limit topics of discussion more than a generalized server would in order to cultivate that safe environment. As a result, thereas special consideration to be taken around user privacy educating users about their privacy, expanded text filters, appropriate topics of discussion, rule continuity when building out rules structure of such an environment. Make sure your team is prepared to handle older users who may find these rules constricting by explaining their importance to your communityas purpose. Understanding Avoiding Moderator Burnout Moderator Burnout: What is it? Starting a new job position activity will always be exciting. Most moderators are eager to help a community that they love that they are an active part of to grow prosper. You spend a lot of time there already, so why would you not want to do your part in helping that community be successful? However as time passes, interests can change initial enthusiasm can wane. As a moderator, you might find yourself spending time in other communities you realize your real world schooling work is a priority over moderating, so there is potential for anxiety to build as you try to juggle all of your responsibilities. Maybe your mental health is being affected by spending many hours a day on internet, dealing with trolls people who simply just want to cause trouble. This can mentally drain you, having to deal with negativity conflict day in day out. When moderating begins to feel like a chore, as opposed to a hobby, thatas when you might feel like moderator burnout has set in. Burnout is emotional, mental, physical exhaustion you feel after a prolonged period of stress brought on by certain activities. Spending too much time in a stressful environment can easily lead to feelings of exhaustion, feeling distant from activity task at hand, simply just having negative feelings when thinking about doing activity task. These negative effects on your body mind eat away at you until you feel like you are at your limit just do not have enough energy motivation in you anymore to continue moderating. Sometimes burnout makes it feel like only thing that can make you happy is to stop being a moderator completely. Signs of Moderator Burnout One of most common signs of moderator burnout is when you have been noticing yourself being less less active when it comes to moderating, as well as being less active in server itself. As a moderator, you have begun to feel like it is a chore for you to be moderating server; something you feel forced to do, knowing it needs to be done with no joy attached to task at hand. Time seems to move so slowly when you are moderating as you are constantly checking clock, just hoping that an hour of your time is enough on server. Your time spent on your server becomes less less as days go by until you have either stepped down completely withdrawn from any activity in server, moderation otherwise. A burgeoning lack of participation is another sign. If you know yourself well enough, you can probably tell when something is bothering you. Perhaps on any normal given day, you are social engage with your other team members as well as with regular server members, but recently youare only chatting in public channels, giving out occasional public warning. You notice that you only really check staff channels when there is a ping. Your account may be in server your name on member list, but youare no longer an active community member. At this point burnout has set in. There may be urge to come in every day give 100% but then you run risk of giving too much, too quickly. You start to dread amount of work necessary to do your part eventually start to taper off. You might notice yourself making more mistakes than normal. Frustration is another part of burnout that can affect mental aspects of moderating. Feeling like you are making too many mistakes are not doing as much as another moderator is a hard thing to put a reason to. Feelings of inadequacy may lead to reprimanding yourself internally, being your own worst critic, finding yourself in a rut, thinking everyone in server is being difficult. You know you are making mistakes, others on your team see it, thinking they are helping by giving you constructive criticism. There is a lack of accomplishment that makes you frustrated, especially in moderating. Nothing you do feels like it is being done right, adding that to difficulties of members of server, frustration kicks in. When telling members of server to do something they continue to post against rules, you begin to wonder if you matter are even making a difference. A Burnout can easily affect your attitude. Moderating tests your patience as some members of server will purposefully push line, seeing what they can get away with. As a new moderator, you might not be as strict, as you are wanting community to not only respect you but to like you. As time passes, your patience may begin to run thin you put up with a lot less while you get more irritated. You have a shift in your attitude can become bitter at what you have to deal with when moderating a server. Avoiding Moderator Burnout After taking time to look at signs of moderator burnout, it is important to know how to avoid it so you your team can find your groove again remember what it feels like to enjoy being not only a moderator but a community member. Everything is healthy with moderation, including, well, moderation. Knowing when you need breaks encouraging yourself, as well as other moderators, to take these breaks can really help with mounting stress levels. Moderating takes a toll on your mental health, so being able to step away catch your breath can really help reset your focus. Reach out to other members on your team that can help with moderator duties shoulder workload so those that are experiencing burnout can feel that it is okay to step away. A big part of working on a team is being honest with each other when things are good when things are not so good. You may be surprised at how eager your team members are to help prop you up when youare feeling low. Remember- you're not alone in this, so feel free to take those breaks be assured that server is not on fire that there are eyes other than yours that are there to share workload. Offline life your overall health should always come before any aspect of online life. Make sure you are not taking on too much, but also have enough to do. This can be a tricky balance. Depending on your moderation experience skills, it can be hard to determine what your work load capabilities are, especially as offline life changes. Be upfront honest with what your team expects from you, but also let them know that if you are feeling overwhelmed, that they can talk to you. Always have an open line of communication so you can find ways to help yourself, as well as others you moderate with. Something that has worked on larger servers that you might be able to incorporate to your server is having a summary of channels. With summary, you can have moderators on your team sign up for which channels they enjoy moderating, as well as others, not feel like you have to be in too many channels at one time. Delegating work makes it seem more manageable less daunting. Encourage yourself your fellow moderators to try new channels after a couple weeks to change everyoneas scenery, as well allowing various team members chance to interact with certain server members that might only hang out in channels that they donat normally moderate. As a moderator, you might feel yourself wanting to do more seek to add to your responsibilities. Suggesting community events helping out organizing running these events makes for a great change of pace to contrast normal moderating duties of watching chat. Events are great for bringing regular members together with moderators. It is a fun task that can bring activity levels up spread some excitement. Create an environment that is fun to moderate in. Having suggesting a staff channel where you your fellow moderators can be yourselves vent is a great way to relieve some stress have your team get to know one another. Ask them questions every day to encourage discussion communication between your entire team. Building a team that works well with one another helps with communication between fellow moderators, so they can express how everyone is feeling, seek advice on stresses in community. A You can get to know each otheras personal lives what other things in life might be causing outside stress. Getting to know each otheras personalities can help determine if someone might easily burn out if they are just more introverted than other moderators on your team. Holding events, such as game nights, where you all play a game online together can really help you other moderators feel at ease, bring enjoyment to everyone, help everyone reset for next day of moderating. One of biggest, perhaps simplest, things you can do to help with moderator burnout is just being thankful. Typing two little words of athank youa can go a long way. As a moderator, you spend your free time helping server, so let your fellow moderators know you appreciate that they chose this as their hobby. To that end, positive specific feedback is one of best ways to let someone know that they did a good job what exactly it was that they did well. By being specific about what youare thanking your moderator for, youare letting them know that their hard work is recognized valued seen. Recognize when they put in a lot of hours on server are here on a day-to-day basis. Finding ways to reward them, whether through gifting Nitro a special recognition in server, can be really fulfilling to them. It reassures them that they are an important part of server are making a difference when helping. Be gracious with your words remind them that they are here with you. It starts a chain reaction you will see moderators thanking other moderators for their hard work. Summary Moderator burnout can happen to anyone at any time. It is important to understand what it is how you can help. Whether you are an owner, administrator, another moderator, it is important to support your team look for signs of burnout so you can suggest ways that might help them in how they are feeling. Always have an open line of communication with your team that fosters honesty. Encourage them yourself to step away when feeling stressed overwhelmed, thank each other for helping in server. Servers are a lot harder to run when doing it alone; moderators that are excited to be there are an important part of making sure things operate smoothly. Patreon X Discord What, Exactly, is Patreon? Letas start with obvious question: what is Patreon? In case you are unfamiliar with Patreon, it is a subscription service for content creators similar to YouTube Memberships Twitch Subscriptions. Supporters ( hereby referred to as apatronsa) can pay a monthly fee to access content from creators they are supporting. This private content can cover a wide range of content including text posts, polls, videos, images, merchandise, more. possibilities are truly endless you, as a content creator, have control over how much value you place on content you produce distribute over Patreon. Patreon also uses tiered platforms based upon monetary commitment. For example, letas say you are a comic book creator that can generate an entire comic in a monthas time. You could charge patrons $5 to access works in progress, maybe snippets of story youare writing, behind scenes streams of you working on an anticipated page panel. At next $10 tier, patrons can gain access to whole comic as a reward, maybe even access polls to help you decide what to do next. Further, a $25 reward could be that patrons have complete access to your entire library, get a physical edition of your comic book sent to them! ideas are endless when it comes to what kind of rewards you can offer your patrons. In fact, one of new ways to explore rewards systems for patrons is via Discord. Why Create Discord Rewards? For content creators that use platforms like Patreon, providing rewards to patrons is an absolute necessity because it directly benefits those who choose to support you. One of simpler rewards creators can provide patrons is a Discord reward system automatically managed by Patreon Bot. An example of such an award allows you to assign one more roles to patrons in your Discord server based upon their subscription tier on Patreon. Once they have their designated roles, you can utilize channel permissions to provide your supporters with exclusive access to aspects of your server like hidden channels perhaps even hoist them in sidebar of your Discord server as an added bonus. This gives them closer access to you as a creator as well as your content your community. This, in turn, can make them feel appreciated as support perhaps allow them to see a direct impact of their support on your content. Installing a Discord Rewards System on Patreon first step to setting up Discord Rewards on Patreon is to have a Patreon account. Once youave started building your Patreon page (or have one completed), youall need to head into your aTiersa section of your page. Once in aTiersa section, pick tier youad like to grant access to your rewards in your Discord server. We recommend that this should be lowest tier youad allow patrons to subscribe at in order to receive a special role in a Discord server that we are presuming is public. Once youave selected your chosen tier, youall need to connect your Patreon to Discord. Now, letas make this reward a reality with following steps: Please note, if you created your server that you plan on adding to your Patreon, youall have no trouble finding it in server list mentioned in Step 4. If youave had a friend, moderator, maybe even a community manager create your server, you might not see it in this list. Make sure you have Manage Server permission in order to see it. If you donat, double check with server owner have them add it to one of your roles in order to successfully connect to Patreon. Customizing Your Discord Rewards With your Patreon page successfully linked with your Discord server, you may notice this message in Patreon: To finalize reward set-up, you need to create actual roles. We recommend creating a different role for each of Patreon tiers you have distinguishing roles by naming them after tiersa name amount of money pledged by patrons of each tier. For example, if you have a $50 per month Patreon tier named Top Contributor, you could name corresponding reward role either a$50a aTop Contributor.a This usually works out most suitably for future rewards, because you can easily distinguish your followers who send $5 a month, versus those sending $50 a month, change role permissions accordingly if you are offering them different levels of Discord access. Remember that it is important to keep Patreon Botas role above all other roles we make for this purpose so it can help manage them. Now that your tier roles are in server, there should be no more red warning text on Patreon Tier Creation page. If there is, give it a quick refresh. disappearance of this text means that you can now check box aGives patrons access to selected Discord roles.a If you are using multiple roles for each tier of your Patreon for organization in your server, make sure theyare all added. After setting your channels permissions spoken about in next step, double check that correct role in your Discord server is associated with proper tier on your Patreon page. Success! Youave completed Patreon Discord integration! Now lets establish accessibility levels. At this point, youall want to build a structure to your server for these new tier roles. Head back to channel list decide how youad like to reward your different tiers. Do you want each tier to have their own channel category, do you want one channel category with different channels designated to different tiers? Make sure to give each category and/or channel permissions associated with each role that you want to have access to that area. We have an based upon channel list image below to see some of our recommendations in action. This example utilizes one channel category for all patrons, but gives certain patron tiers different levels of access. A Youall notice Patreon allows you to assign users multiple roles when they subscribe to a tier. This makes it handy to ensure your private channels categories are easier to manage across different role tiers. In our provided example youall see that all patrons have access to an exclusive general text voice channel to talk to each other regardless of tiers. However, different tier levels are given access to different additional perks such as sharing social media links for creator to follow back, polls for future content, a VIP text voice chat to better talk to creator theyare supporting. Conclusion Congratulations on launching your new and/or updated Patreon page! beauty of this system is that you can continue to create new roles channel permissions to best serve your community as you continue to grow. Now that youare done with basic steps outlined in this guide, all you have to do is edit/add/drop/shift roles around as needed to ensure you are making most of your Discord Rewards patron program. Patreon rewards give your fans supporters exclusives in exchange for supporting your work. Having this automated system to handle manage your supporters means you can spend more time making new content, less time worrying about a bot, a function in Discord whenever new patrons sign up. It also makes managing permissions much more simpler because you have a lot more control over which roles a patron is assigned to based on their subscription tier. Best Practices for Moderating Content Creation Creating an Area for Content Creators Content creation is one of coolest aspects of a community! Even those that do not create themselves can celebrate passion excitement that comes with sharing art. Artists shouldnat be regulated to just a generalized #media channel where all users are posting photos, you should consider instead giving them their own designated area in server. This shows these users that moderators see their contributions to community appreciate what they are doing. This area can be a channel dedicated to sharing art content, even an entire channel category depending on how your moderation team wishes to interact with your communityas creators how active this part of your community may be. Listen to their needs expand modify this category as necessary. Unique Rules of Road When building out a content creation realm in a server, it is important to keep in mind that your moderation team may encounter some new situations that don't apply to rest of server. Of course, content creators are subject to same laws of land in place for entire community, but there may need to be some of these unique rules of road to consider including: Plagiarism. This is practice of taking someone elseas work claiming that it is your own. Plagiarizing another content creator should not be tolerated within any creative space. It should be highly discouraged acted upon with moderator intervention if your community brings an accusation of plagiarism to your moderation team. As moderators, it is important to understand difference between plagiarism finding inspiration in someone elseas work. Tracing another creatorsa artwork is most common form of plagiarism, whereas being inspired by an original character to try out a new pose, color scheme, scene featuring them is inspiration. While creators are often looking out for each other willing to bring concerns about plagiarism to moderation teams, it is important to be able to look for it yourself by familiarizing yourself with your artistsa styles reverse image searching images of concern to your team. Be sure to be able to explain to your community why plagiarizing is harmful when these situations arise. Managing Constructive Criticism vs. Hate. Your content creation channels are going to be accessible to your entire server. This is so that entire fandom can celebrate together, but also to drive interest from users to support your content creators. This means that average user can come in comment on content. There is a line between constructive criticism hate. Watch out for it as moderators be prepared to intervene should anything cross line into attacks hate-filled commentary that would give content creation an unwelcoming atmosphere. Oftentimes in creative communities it is an unspoken rule that you should not give constructive criticism unless it is specifically asked for. average user may not realize this could accidentally offend an artist if theyare not aware of this. As a moderator, itas important to help artists understand constructive criticism when they ask for it while shielding them from trolls baseless hate. Sharing content can be intimidating, so it is especially important to ensure that content creation channels remain positive respectful environments. One way you can mitigate this issue is by making it clear in your rules that unless artist specifically asks for constructive criticism, that feedback of that nature is not allowed. Bumping. Art bumping may occur in an art channel where artists feel their content isnat easily viewed by enough people. This is essentially act of media getting bumped up in chat from other people sharing their media at same time from chatter about other works. An accusation of bumping usually comes up when a creator feels their art isnat being noticed, if they believe someone they do not have a good relationship with is intentionally bumping their work. In this case, itas important to defuse situation not allow any forms of bullying by de-escalating conflict. Maintaining an environment where users respect everyone's work is necessary for peace of mind of creators consumers alike. You can also consider building out a channel category instead of a single channel which would allow for a channel dedicated to posting art a separate one for discussion. You may contemplate a rule of not posting art within a certain time frame of another creator posting, but be cautioned that this can lead to over-moderation by your community. NSFW content. If your server allows Not Safe for Work content, it is important that you create a specific channel for it that can be marked as an NSFW channel separate from your regular content creation channels. In line with Discordas policies, this will not allow users under age of 18 to see this channel without agreeing to a prompt that says they are not a minor. It is also important to consider that implementation of an NSFW channel disqualifies you from being a A Partnered Verified Discord server. Make sure to keep expectations around SFW NSFW content creation in line with that of your entire server, offer to answer any questions in DMs if a creator thinks a piece may toe boundaries you enforce. Advertising Commissions. If you have a blanket ban on advertisement in your community, you may not want to make an exception to rule here. However, if you decide to allow advertising commissions in your server, you are allowing more commissions to flow to your creators. Do not allow other users to beg for free art try to guilt creators with open commissions into providing free content to them. It may be case that your moderation team will have to enforce boundaries if someone who commissions a creator within your community doesnat pay them revokes payment. Conversely, if a creator requires payment up front then does not deliver work doesnat refund commissioner, moderator intervention should occur to no longer allow them to accept commissions from other members. To be clear, you are not responsible for their financial disputes business transactions. Ultimately, creators should look into their specific payment provider website for policy information on fraud filing disputes, both of which are out of your control. Your job as a moderation team is protecting creators from scammers who make themselves known within your community. Youave created this space to cater to creators need them to know that users who take advantage of them creators who take advantage of users are not welcome here. Low Quality/Low Effort Art. Something your moderation team should consider is whether not you will be moderating low quality low effort art. Lower quality art has ability to potentially create a divide with more experienced artists diminish overall quality of your artistic channels. Expectedly, this is a very subjective divisive topic. Moderating alow qualitya alow efforta art can run risk of upsetting younger users creators that are at very beginning of learning how to create. When considering moderating low quality art, be sure to display empathy compassion to avoid coming off as inconsiderate rude. Be honest realistic in your descriptions requirements for these art spaces so that users may have a better idea as to what is isnat acceptable both content quality wise. Other ways to healthily promote higher quality artists is via potential role systems, automatic pins, weekly artist highlights, which will be discussed in further detail below. Off Topic Art. As a team, think about whether you want your artist channels to be dedicated to purpose of your server if you want to also allow off topic content. Once this rule is decided, check that your moderation team is on same page for enforcement nudging should you decide not to allow off topic art. Engaging Content Creators There are several ways to keep your communityas content creators engaged, which helps to showcase how much your moderation team values their contributions to server. Discord has several native features that can showcase your communityas talent in emojis, stickers, banners, server icons. While a banner a server icon are important to be branded thus rarely changed, generating emojis stickers (especially from within your community) is a good way to bond, celebrate inside jokes with your community, show some love for your creators. Oftentimes communities will employ certain yearly opportunities like emoji elections where creators can submit emojis for consideration allow your community to vote as a whole. Continued engagement with your content creators is also important. If you are engaging your community with generalized game server events, examine whether you can engage your content creators in same way with art events monthly prompts as this promotes community bonding. If your community has a system to reward winners for their work participation in events, work to instill same kind of system for art adjacent events prompts. Finally, some communities may want to install a special role for content creators, especially those that are active constantly contributing quality work. This will showcase artists in server to rest of server. Do keep in mind however, that unique role colors can lead to inadvertent exclusivity a social hierarchy within server. This can also have effect of alienating artists that do not yet have role, which is why you should be careful when thinking about if you want to introduce this role to your community. If you decide to bring a specialized role into your server, take step to have clear criteria for users to qualify for it as well as easy rules for moderators to grant it to users. This ensures that your moderation team can avoid accidentally leaving someone out hurting someoneas feelings. Avoid bringing a role into your server if your server has had problems with role related hierarchies in past. Listen to your communityas needs anticipate potential problems! Conclusion Content creators are an exciting subset of fandom that should be welcomed to your community! Ensure that they have their own area to share all forms of content in, whether it be a channel an entire channel category. Be aware that content creation arenas often come with unique rule considerations that you may not have encountered previously in daily moderation of your server. Talk to your moderation team about everything before launching this channel category so that you are all on same wavelength with enforcement before jumping in. Continuously engage your creators involve them in artistic aspects of server, such as emoji sticker creation. Art can bring people together, having a healthy artistic space within your community will provide a new way for your community to bond celebrate your fandom! Managing Interpersonal Relationships Degrees of Interpersonal Relationships Any relationship between two members of a community can be described as an interpersonal relationship. These relationships exist on a wide spectrum. As you participate in a community, you are most likely going to develop connections to varying degrees with other members of community. As a moderator, this may even be expected as part of your duties to promote community engagement healthy conversations. Thatas perfectly normal, as itas very natural for people who spend a lot of time communicating to develop closer ties to one another. Every kind of relationship, from mere acquaintances to romantic partners, can occur in a Discord community, every relationship you form as a moderator will carry its own unique challenges responsibilities in order to ensure you are performing your duties to best of your ability. Any kind of interpersonal relationship can create difficulty in moderation, but as nature of relationship changes, so too does unconscious bias you may experience. A friendship between a moderator a member of community is least problematic type of intersocial relationship, but as these friendships form it is still important to take notice be aware of them. As a moderator it is your duty to be available to everyone in community, even people who you may not ever see as a friend, so you must resist temptation to devote more time attention to people you more easily connect with. If your biases toward your friends begin to show up in your moderation efforts, many more serious harder to diagnose problems can arise. Feelings of ""elitism"" afavoritisma can start to take hold disgruntled members may take advantage of your friendships to excuse justify their own behavior, so take care to make sure that you are remaining impartial. A friendship between a moderator a member of community that persists for a long period can evolve into a closer more open relationship. These relationships are built on trust shared experience, can be more difficult to impartially manage than regular friendships acquaintances. This kind of relationship could come from fact that this person is someone you know from another server, in real life, possibly even a family member. No matter what scenario, closeness of this kind of relationship makes it very difficult, sometimes impossible, to remove your own partiality from equation. Special care must be taken to ensure you engage listen to other moderators on your team when someone you are closely involved with is in question. When in doubt, it may be best to remove yourself from situation entirely, which we will discuss in more detail later in article. A romantic relationship between a moderator a member of community can (and does!) happen. As is natural, if you meet someone who shares common interests has an attractive personality, over time your relationship may progress into something more profound. Romantic relationships are certainly most difficult to manage as a moderator. saying holds true, especially in new romantic relationships, that you will see your significant other through arose-tinted glassesa which tend to blind you from their potential flaws wrongdoings. Additionally, other members can very quickly see a budding relationship as an opportunity for a fellow member to grab power through moderator they are romantically involved with. As a best practice, you should remove yourself from any moderation decisions involving a user that you are in a romantic relationship with. Failing to do so can has directly caused death of some communities, especially when romantic partners are both on same moderator team. This type of one-sided interpersonal relationship is rare among moderators because of connection a moderation team usually has to content creator personality that they moderate for. More commonly, a user witnessing a friendly moderator carrying out their daily duties to interact with their server can develop such a relationship. However, this type of relationship requires an extra level of care awareness, as they can quickly become toxic if not managed appropriately. Always be aware of them, consider their existence when making certain moderation decisions. DMA has an article exclusively dedicated to parasocial relationships for further reading. On Visibility One thing to keep in mind when evaluating your relationships in your communities- regardless of nature of thema is that your relationships connections if played out in server are most likely visible to other members of community. When interacting with your friends, close friends, even your partner in a space with other people such as your server, members of community may pick up on fact that you do have these relationships. As with any kind of community, there may be feelings of exclusion perception of ain-groupsa that can arise in, especially when it comes to relationships between a aregulara server member a highly public visible one like a moderator. A responsibility you have as a moderator is to take this dynamic into account effects it can have on your members how they view you your friendships. Making sure that your friendships relationships are not creating an exclusionary atmosphere for other community members, where they feel like itas unwanted difficult for them to contribute. On subject of avisibilitya, a moderator a whether they are consistently conscious of it not - is someone in server who has power over other users in that space. It is not always easiest task balancing dynamic between being part of a community cultivating relationships friendships with being conscious of your role within that community as a moderator what that imbalance may influence. This difference in responsibility position can make relationships connections with other users in server more complicated. You may not be directly aware of it when youare chatting with fellow server members, but there will be users in your community who are keenly aware of your status as a moderator. This scrutiny can affect how they approach becoming friends with you as well as affect how they view your own relationships with other server members. Always keep this dynamic in mind be aware of how your position may affect not just how users interact with you but also how they interpret your relationships conversations with other members. A Higher Standard Just as it is natural for these relationships to form, it is also human nature to unconsciously develop act on a bias toward people closest to you. As a moderator, that natural bias is something you must actively resist, take conscious steps to avoid. What happens when friend of a moderator has a bad day doesnat act in spirit of rules of community? In an ideal scenario, moderatoras response would be same reasonable response that would be expected if offending member were anyone else. Your response to these situations will have a profound impact on your communityas attitude toward you as a moderator, as showing favoritism will quickly evaporate communityas trust in your ability to be impartial. Moderators are human, for inexperienced seasoned moderators alike, this kind of scenario can prove to be one of most significant tests of their ability to manage conflict. In preparing for this scenario, most important tool in a moderatoras arsenal is self-awareness. It is burden of a moderator that this commitment comes above any interpersonal relationships that may form during time spent engaging with a community. Being ever-mindful of your responsibility role in a community can help temper depth of relationships that you build. As a recommended best practice, moderators should be careful about building interpersonal relationships of depth (close romantic relationships) in communities they moderate, including with other moderators. only guaranteed way for a moderator to remain impartial in upholding rules for all members is to exclusively maintain friendships within their community, but this isnat always reasonable for communities that you are closely involved in. Should you find yourself in a difficult scenario involving a member with whom you have a close interpersonal relationship, here are some best practices for managing situation: first step in successfully managing a scenario that involves someone you have an interpersonal relationship with is to take stock of your own investment. How are you feeling? Are you calm capable of making rational judgment? Is your gut reaction to jump to defense of member? is opposite true - do you feel need to be overly harsh in order to compensate for potential bias? Carefully self-evaluate before proceeding with any action. wrong type of moderator response in a scenario like this can often exacerbate distract from actual issue at hand, potentially weaken your communityas trust in your capabilities as a moderator. If in course of your self-evaluation you realize that you cannot positively answer any all of these questions, it may be necessary for you to more seriously evaluate whether not you need to make difficult decisions regarding your position as a moderator. If your interpersonal relationship is preventing you from fulfilling your duties as a moderator, you may need to consider either abdicating your role as a moderator ending relationship until circumstances improve. Neither option is easy ideal, but making tough decisions for health of community is your primary responsibility as a moderator. Once youave determined that youare capable of proceeding with moderation, evaluate scenario to identify what problem is whether it immediately needs to be addressed. If there is no immediate need to step in, as a best practice it is usually better to defer to another moderator whenever your personal relationships are involved. Contact another member of your moderation team to get a second opinion some backup if necessary. If immediate action is required, a concise direct reference to rules is usually sufficient to defuse situation. Use your best judgment, but be aware that likelihood of arules lawyeringa is higher with someone who trusts you sees you as a friend in these scenarios because moderation action can be seen as a violation of that trust relationship. Clearly fairly indicating grounds for you speaking up is crucial to prevent further issues from arising. Additionally, be careful about what is discussed in private with person involved in this scenario following any action. There is a higher likelihood of them contacting you via DM to talk about your decisions because of level of trust that exists between you. As a best practice, it is usually best to avoid litigating rules of server with any member, especially a member with which you have an interpersonal relationship. Politely excuse yourself, if prudent, redirect conversation by giving member a place to productively resolve their own issue. As with any moderation action, once taken it is best practice to leave a note for your team about what action was taken why. Another period of self-evaluation is a good idea after any action is taken. Ask yourself, was action taken in alignment with rules of your community? Was it fair to both offending member, as well as other members of your community? Was your decision affected by your bias towards offending member? If necessary unclear, ask your teammates for their outside perspective. Summary Taking moderation action when offending member is one with whom a moderator has an interpersonal relationship can be one of most difficult scenarios that a moderator can find themselves in. Set yourself up for success as a moderator by tempering type of relationships you build within your community cultivating ability to self-evaluate. best tool available to a moderator in these scenarios is self-awareness ability to recognize when their own biases prevent them from acting fairly. Remember that moderation is a team sport, that team is your most valuable resource in impartially upholding rules values of your community. Considering Mental Health in Your Community Importance of Mental Health Awareness Before we discuss what to consider when introducing mental health channels to a community, it is important to understand difference between mental health a mental illness, to be aware of realities of what these terms entail. Mental health mental illness are strongly intertwined, but very different. People with good mental health can develop a mental illness, while those with no mental illness can have poor mental health. Mental health reflects our emotional, physiological, social well-being. Though topic of mental health is still quite taboo to talk about in certain circles, there is help available for those who wish to seek it. Mental health is a crucial aspect of a personas existence as it affects our actions, emotions, thoughts. A healthy mental state enhances effectiveness productivity in work, education, interpersonal relationships. A mental illness is a disorder of mind that affects not just our thinking but also our energy, mood, occasionally our conduct behavior. Such a diagnosis may make it difficult to cope with many obligations of life. Common mental illness diagnoses are anxiety disorders, such as panic attacks, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, specific types of fears. There are also mood disorders like depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia. An excellent guide for identifying mental health challenges pathways to care can be found here. Being informed aware about mental health issues is a great start when youare considering how it may affect apply to your community team. As an illness can manifest in a variety of different ways, it is vital to be ready have clear guidelines on these complex topics when dealing with online communities both for your staff internally for your community externally. An often overlooked result of community moderation is how it can affect mental health of your team. Moderator burnout stems from situations that harm your teamas mental health, understanding signs how to deal with it are essential in building a strong online community led by a moderation team that can act as a strong support system not only to your community, but to each other. Adding a Mental Health Channel in Your Server There is a lot to consider when discussing if you want to add a channel that addresses is dedicated to talking about topics that deal with mental health within your Discord server. Firstly, you have to determine whether not your community needs a mental health discussion channel thread. Consider whether not your team has seen much talk about mental health-related content in your community whether such conversations have remained respectful even without your teamas active intervention. If these conversations have devolved into arguments negativity in your community, maybe re-evaluate if you feel this type of channel will benefit those in your server really think about if you can find a way have enough resources to guarantee that it remains a safe space for all users. easy way to contemplate whether not a mental health channel would fit into your server is by looking at general topic of your server. If your Discord server is more focused on gaming, it may not make sense to allow something that drastically differs from your serveras purpose. Contrarily, a server focusing on community building might be a safer space for a mental health channel. Ultimately, itas very subjective all about listening to not just needs of your community but tone of your server. A lot goes into developing an excellent community introducing a mental health channel is not easy as you have to consider how to best moderate it. This includes how youall be utilizing auto moderation text filters in channel as accidental flags in highly emotional situations can be more harmful than helpful. If you do decide to create a mental health channel thread, it is important to be aware of all possible situations to be flexible prepared for unexpected scenarios. Understanding that some moderators arenat comfortable in these situations is important if you decide to allow such a channel on your server, you need to be able to vet your moderators future helpers. As moderators arenat mental health professionals, they shouldnat be treated as such should also be presented with option to opt out of spaces such as this. Therefore, it is vitally important that you establish clear internal guidelines procedures to set expectations for channel at a manageable level. Facilitating Healthy Discussions about Mental Health Discussing mental health in a positive way can be challenging as it is a sensitive topic with a variety of experiences attached to it. However, there are some ways to make this an easier experience from a moderation standpoint, most important of which is having clear server rules moderator guidelines for how to act when these discussions are taking place having clear escalation protocols for if things go south. Talking with your moderators about mental health challenging times in life as well as facilitating breaks for them demonstrates that you care about their well-being. This is an integral part of establishing a healthy environment for your moderators solid internal relationships. creation of specific mental health-related guidelines ensure that users remain respectful of each other that conversations are within designated guidelines of your community. Some suggestions for creating these guidelines include: Escalation protocols are another important foundation for when mental health discussions take place. Some ideas to consider when implementing them: a Moderation of mental health channels can be a touchy subject. On one hand, moderators should be firm in removing harassers users who are disrespecting others. On other hand, moderators should try their best not to over-moderate. There must be a balance to ensure that these channels that have very sensitive subject matters within them are moderated with care. Some ways to do this are: a There are an incredible amount of resources available for mental health supportaeverything from emergency phone numbers to suicide hotlines LGBTQ+ helplines. Find a Helpline resource consists of a list of global helplines hotlines. We also recommend looking at TWLOHA resource, which is a non-profit movement dedicated to presenting hope finding help for people struggling with their mental health. Discord has also partnered with Crisis Text Line, a non-profit that provides text-based volunteer support for people in crisis. You can learn more about our integration partnership how to use it on Discord here. Some more examples of support sites include: Not all communities are prepared to host a mental health channel thread, there is a lot to consider before adding one to your server. While allowing talk about mental health can be incredibly beneficial, it is just as important to realize that moderators arenat professionals should not be put in those positions if they arenat comfortable with it. Thatas why we advise that you carefully consider your current environment, your communityas purpose, implications that might occur if you choose to add one. Whatever you decide is best for your community, we believe that education is key. It may be helpful to think about adding a channel post that gives people access to professional support lines, such as FindaHelpline TWLOHA resource, as well as other resources laid out in this article. Generally, facilitating a healthy discussion around important topics of any kind is essential in helping to develop stronger communities online. Make sure that your community is a safe space for everyone that chooses to call it home! Twitch X Discord Is Discord for Twitch Necessary? At some point during their Twitch careers, most streamers will ask question, aIs having a Discord for my community necessary?a. Most streamers are already struggling enough with configuring their overlays, cultivating relationships with other streamers, taking time to edit design future content. Will working with yet-another platform really help move my streaming career forward, is it just another item on endless list of distractions? Most of streamers who ask this question fail to understand how Discord fits into their high-level plan for scaling their brand community. One of biggest misconceptions is that Twitch can be used for every step of growing your channel, brand, community. Twitch is only one of many platforms required for success. While Twitch is well-known for engaging monetizing your active community base, it struggles with content discovery, data collection, long term retention. Twitch should instead be viewed as a tool to engage connect with an already-existing community. image above categorizes content platforms into 3 primary groups; Discovery, Engagement, Activation. Content platforms that focus on Discovery are specifically designed to spread new, persistent content that can be viewed later. These platforms are ideal for finding new community members fans to engage with by inviting them to join another more personalized platform, such as a fansite, email list, Discord community. It is through this persistent community that you can advertise ways to support engage directly with primary content creators by supporting through Patreon viewing/subscribing on Twitch. platforms above can obviously be used for different purposes, but theyare segmented as such because of how their primary business models work. Discovery platforms run on ads focus on getting you to consume more content. Engagement platforms are more personalized, with content not designed for larger audiences frequently encourage users to take action. Activation platforms are designed to have monthly direct recurring payment models that provide an enhanced personalized version of Engagement content. Going Live Back Again With a better understanding of primary purposes of each platform, you can begin to design your user experience in a way that provides new community members an easy direct way to participate in show dedication to community. Regardless of how your Twitch viewers discover your channel content, directing them to a centralized community hub will allow them to share their appreciation with others, go from being an individual fan to being part of a community. To get most out of Discord encourage members to join your stream, spend time with your community before after each livestream. Before each stream, spend 15 minutes chatting with your active Discord members to ask them about their day receive feedback about your content. As you begin your stream, post announcements on your social media platforms use a bot to alert your Discord community that youave gone live. Moderators should continue to oversee discussions in your Discord, but encourage members to watch livestream as it occurs. Bots scripts can also be used to remind users to join Discord community if they havenat already, as well as following on social media for updates alerts. Finally, as your stream is ending, remind community that youall be available in Discord for a short time to discuss stream answer any questions. Some streamers will also include special events for high-ranking members subscribers, which can help encourage collaboration active use of server. Playing with Viewers via Discord One of most effective ways to engage directly with your community is to create content with them. This can either be done while livestreaming, else as a scheduled event that community can participate in. Events need not necessarily be games, but can also include Q&A sessions discussions about a topic of interest. Special precautions must be made while playing with viewers as youare live to prevent astream snipinga, where community members will attempt to disrupt your stream game while youare live. Moderators should take note be ready to handle disruptions while engaging directly with community, but most situations can be prevented by assigning restrictions requirements to be on stream with host. For example, being a subscriber to community requiring participants to apply for a spot if game has a limited number of participants can help ensure everybody understands follows rules. Discord for Twitch Checklist As you grow your Discord community, members will have different expectations of what your server offers, how itas managed what server is used for. For example, a community with 500 members may not be expected to have a full events calendar, but they would definitely expect that roles have been properly configured so that subscribers appear as a different username color with more permissions access to restricted channels. Below is a simple checklist for functionality your server should have: Conclusion We hope these guidelines have helped you to determine if creating a Discord server for your Twitch audience is right fit for you. most essential thing to keep in mind is that your Discord server is not just an appendix to your Twitch presence. It serves as its own entity community that needs to be fostered with same, if not more, personal attention care in order for it to blossom. With right mindset efforts, your Discord community can bolster your Twitch presence bring your community closer together, for longer Application of Metaphors in Moderation Five Types of Community Moderation Approaches An academic study interviewed dozens of moderators across multiple platforms grouped moderation approaches into five different categories: a Being able to understand perspective behind each of these approaches then applying them to your own community as needed is a powerful ability as a community manager. This article will discuss in more detail what these five categories mean how you can apply them within your own communities. Nurturing Supporting Communities Moderators that nurture support communities (nurturing-type moderators) focus on shaping community conversations that occur in server among members to match their vision. foundation for their moderation actions stem from their desire to keep community positive welcoming for everyone, not just long-time members. They seek to create a community with a good understanding of rules that can then develop itself in a positive way over time. These types of moderators may implement pre-screening of members content in their communities by implementing a verification gate using an automoderator to filter out low quality members content curate conversations of server to be better suited to their vision. Although this passive behind-the-scenes guidance is one type of nurturing moderator, these types of moderators also often actively engage with community as a aregular member.a For nurturing-type moderators, this engagement isnat meant specifically to provide an example of rule-following behavior, but rather to encourage high-quality conversations on server where members will naturally enjoy engaging with each other moderators as equals. They are leading by example. Overseeing Facilitating Communities While nurturing- supporting-type moderators operate based upon their long-term vision for a community, moderators that are focused on overseeing facilitating communities focus on short-term needs day-to-day interactions of community members. They are often involved in handling difficult scenarios fostering a healthy community. For example, these types of moderators will step in when there is conflict within community attempt to mediate between parties to resolve any misunderstandings restore A friendliness to server. Depending on issue, they may also refer to specific rules community knowledge to assign validity to one viewpoint to respectfully discredit behavior of another. In both situations, moderators will attempt to elicit agreement from those involved about their judgment resolve conflict to earn respect of their community members restore order to server. Those in overseeing facilitating communities category may also take less involved approaches towards maintaining healthy day-to-day interaction among members, such as quickly making decisions to mute, kick, ban someone that is causing an excessive amount of trouble rather than attempting to talk them down. They may also watch for bad behavior report it to other moderators to step in handle, allow community to self-regulate when possible rather than attempting to directly influence conversation. Fighting for Communities Where overseeing facilitating community moderators emphasize interactive communicative approaches to solving situations with community members, moderators who see themselves as fighting for communities heavily emphasize taking action content removal rather than moderating via a two-way interaction. They may see advocating for their community members as part of their job A want to defend community from those who would try to harm it. Oftentimes, moderators themselves may have been on receiving end of problematic behavior in past desire to keep others in their community from having to deal with same thing. This attitude is often driver behind their A no-nonsense approach to moderation while strictly enforcing communityas rules values, quickly working to remove hateful content users acting in bad faith. Moderators in this category are similar to subset of moderators that view moderation from overseeing facilitating communities, specifically ones that quickly remove those who are causing trouble. However, compared to perspective that misbehavior stems from immaturity, moderators that fight for communities have a stronger focus on content being posted in community, rather than intent behind it. In contrast to moderators in overseeing facilitating communities category, these moderators take a firmer stance in their moderation style do not worry about complaints from users who have broken rules. Instead they accept that pushback on difficult decisions they make is part of moderation process. Governing Regulating Communities Those that see themselves as governing regulating communities see moderation team as a form of governance place great emphasis on appropriate desirable application of community rules, often seeing process for making moderation decisions as similar to a court system making decisions based on a set of community alaws.a They may also see themselves as representatives of community moderation team emphasize need to create policies enforce rules that benefit community as a whole Moderators in this category may consciously run community according to specific government principles, such as having a vote on community changes. However, they may also achieve consensus within team about changes to server without involving community at large even have one moderator make final determination about community changes. This afinal decisiona power is usually exercised in terms of vetoing a proposed policy issuing a ruling on an issue that is particularly contentious within mod team community. Very rarely would a form of decision-making be exercised, it would be granted to very specific members of a team hierarchy such as server owner administrative lead. Even so, moderators in this category find following procedure to be important tend to involve others to some extent in making decisions about community rather than acting on their own. This tendency is also seen in way that they approach rule enforcement. Moderators that see themselves as governing regulating communities view rules as if they were laws of a country. They meticulously review situations that involve moderator intervention to determine which rule was broken how it was broken while referring to similar past cases to see how those were handled. These moderators also tend to interpret rules more strictly, according to aletter of law,a attempt to leave no room for argument while building their acasea against potential offending users. Managing Communities Moderators that see themselves as managing communities view moderation as a second job to be approached in a professional way. They pay particular attention to way they interact with other members of community moderation team as well as moderation teams of other communities, strive to represent team positively to their community members. This type of moderator may appear more often as communities become very large as there becomes a need for clearer, standard processes division of responsibility between moderators in order to handle workload. Though this metaphor focuses more on moderator team dynamics than relationships between moderators users, it can also shape way moderators approach interactions with users. Managing-type moderators are more likely to be able to point users toward written rules, guidelines, processes when they have questions. Managing-type moderators are also much less likely to make aon-the-flya decisions about new issues that come up. Instead, they will document issue post about it in proper place, such as a private moderator channel, so it can be discussed a new process can be created if needed. This approach also makes it easier to be transparent with users about decision making. When there are established, consistent processes in place for handling issues, users are less likely to feel that decisions are random arbitrary. Another strength of this approach is evident in efficient on-boarding processes. When a community has clear processes for documenting, discussing, handling different situations, adding new moderators to team is much easier because there is already a set of written instructions for how they should do their job. This professional approach to moderation can also help moderators when they are attempting to form partnerships make connections with other servers. An organized moderation team is much more likely to make a good impression with potential partners. If you want to learn more about managing moderation teams, click here. Conclusion As you read through this article, you may have found that some moderation category descriptions resonated with you more than others. more experience you have moderating, wider variety of moderation approaches youall implement. Rather than trying to find a single abesta approach from among these categories, itas better to consider your overall balance in using them how often you consider moderation issues from each perspective. For example, you can nurture support a community by controlling how members arrive at your server curating content of your informational channels to guide conversation, while also managing overseeing interactions of honest, well-intentioned community members quickly banning those who seek to actively harm your community. Itas perfectly natural that each person on your moderation team will have an approach that comes easier to them than others no category is superior to another. Making sure all moderation categories are represented in your moderation team helps to ensure a well-rounded staff that values differing opinions. Even just understanding each of these frameworks is an important component of maintaining a successful community. Now that you understand these different approaches, you can consciously apply them as needed so that your community can continue to thrive! Internationalization of a Community Expanding from one Language Which languages to choose entirely depend on type of server you run. For a community server, it is recommended to adjust it to communityas needs. Usually, most commonly featured languages outside of English are German, French, Spanish, Turkish Russian. You can determine your featured language by community analysis, server insights (if your server has them), demand. What nationalities are represented most in your server? Which users struggle most with English upon joining server if theyare struggling, what language do they usually communicate in? In addition to that, you can consider starting a survey every time you your staff feel ready to expand into a new language. On other hand, if you make a server for a brand company, it is recommended to go by your target audience. Introducing features like internationalization needs carefully planned, but steady steps. If your server was originally English only, itas not recommended to expand into too many languages at once for a variety of reasons. Agree on one language (preferably most popular one in your server) slowly add on from there, if need presents itself. Once you figure out a pattern a stable structure on how to approach expansion, you can add more sections for different languages. Server Design As your server grows, so does Discord. It is vital to keep in mind that your server can get a lot of incoming users who have never really used Discord before- so make sure your serveras design is user-friendly, easily accessible, has a clear structure. Also, remember that more languages you feature on your server, more text-and voice channels will appear for your staff. It is recommended to hoist most important text-channels at top of your server. That may include announcements, server-info, rules, optionally giveaways more. To ensure global accessibility, translate important parts like rules server information in every language you feature alongside your main language. Additionally, you can add a server guide for easier coordination. Both new users your staff will benefit from that. It should cover a list of accessible text voice channels as well as a short but detailed description of each. Furthermore, try to integrate every additional language in a way that utilizes it to its utmost potential. You can do so in form of a feedback suggestion channel in each languageas category. This lets you hear directly from users that would benefit from that additional language chat most. Consider having staff that are dedicated to interacting with each section instead of focusing all their attention on global chat. Having these additional language chats makes it so that your international users donat feel less validated only because they donat want to canat communicate in global chat. You can implement that same line of thinking when organizing server events. Consider alternating between server-wide international events as demand allows. For latter, analyze your serveras activity for each region host it at time with most community engagement for those users for best results. You can apply same system to voice channels by creating a few global voice chats then adding language specific channels. Your staff should only allow one common language to be spoken in global chats redirect every other language into their appropriate voice channels. Creating a Server with One More Languages From Scratch If you want to feature multiple languages with equal amounts, you can effectively combine multiple Discord servers in one. For first half, it will be same as before: Have at least one international general-chat before you split server into each language. That way every user is able to communicate with entirety of server instead of just their language-specific section. Let users choose their language via a reaction verification with option to opt-out change regions. You can summarise most important aspects in a common text-channel, text being translated into every featured language. simplest way to manage split server is by having same channels categories, but in different languages. This will heavily depend on type of server you moderate, but recommended channels for every section are ones you would usually include in a monolingual server. These channels should include things like rules, announcements, general-chat, bot-commands, media, optionally a looking-for-game channel, more. Take care to ensure you have appropriate translation for each channel. Moreover, community events can be a lot more diverse. You can host a variety of events for each language as well as let all of them participate in shared events. Take time to analyze each nationas activity also take holidays national days into account. Staff Arrangement Internationalizing your server may mean that your moderation team grows to be larger than expected, so to make it easy for users to contact appropriate staff you can separate moderators by nicknames, colors, role hoist. Nicknames: If you want to have moderation team equally displayed throughout server, you can arrange moderators by nicknames. Simply add language they moderate at beginning of their nickname so they are alphabetically sorted below each other. Users will have an easier time recognizing appropriate moderators, but with a large staff, this might end up looking a little busy. Some moderators tend to change their nicknames frequently may not be big fans of having tag in front of their name, either. Colors: It is advised to have colors of each moderator role in same shade with a slight but still visible difference. This helps to differentiate moderators regular users will be able to tell difference immediately. Remember that newer users might not check each role just contact first seemingly online moderator they see. Role hoist: If you display only accompanying moderator role for each language, ensure that you have a common, not displayed role for all moderators so one team is not less validated than other. Users should definitely be able to contact appropriate staff ping correct moderators to help them out with issues in chat. but, when displaying a lot of teams with many members each, some of them might be pushed off screen. You run risk that some moderators that are displayed below other teams seem less aimportant validateda to community, but shared staff role should fix that problem easily. Moderation While moderating a multilingual server it is crucial to have moderators that are native speakers at least fluent in each language that you decide to expand to. Having moderators that are native speakers makes it so that they not only understand textbook definitions of what is being said but understand cultural contexts that may come with international chats. However, these moderators should also be accomplished capable with other responsibilities of being a mod that lie outside of just being fluent. While community moderators should follow basic tasks (moderate chat, be accessible for questions, guide users), things in multilingual servers can be a bit more advanced. Moderators need to identify address inappropriate behavior towards other cultures in an authoritative, but instructive way. Furthermore, they need to free chat from toxic behavior control discussions about sensitive topics. In addition to that, they have to be open for cultural questions of users who chose a language they are not fluent in yet. Both user staff need to work their way around language barriers together. Theyall be required to help users, as well as resolve disputes, often at same time. For that, theyall have to rely on their communication skills in order to succeed in resolving both situations any other issue that may require it. Without good communication skills, users won't understand what you're trying to convey to them, which should be assertive but tolerant. Moderators can under no circumstances be discriminating towards users of other cultures beliefs. It is their responsibility to create a civil, welcoming comfortable environment for all users. While you are always entitled to your own opinion, make sure to keep a neutral output in public part of server try not to let it cloud your judgement. Managing several moderators from all around world can turn out to be quite tricky. Organizing meetings waiting for everyoneas approval for one date may be a real challenge to deal with. Getting majority of team on board could take days, especially with difference in time zones. One simple solution is to delegate some captains representative moderators for each team. They will gather feedback, opinions suggestions from rest of staff team discuss them with rest of staff during meeting. That way itas easier to organize staff meetings, but they can also directly inform rest of their team who could not make it due to time conflicts. Depending on size of staff teams, you can appoint more than one moderator for that position. When creating more than one staff role, make sure that everyone is comfortable with their position their responsibilities. Misalignment can lead to misunderstanding later on, it might create needless tension amongst staff. Consider appointing one representative in each region that your server is branching out to. That will open possibility to have regional staff meetings where language culture specific issues suggestions can be discussed without need for an international meeting with whole team. While not every moderator will get chance to get to know every other moderator from different regions in these larger moderation rosters, it is important that team feels united regardless. Donat leave it up to one team to tackle an issue- let them know that they can always ask for help from rest of staff. Global Accessibility: Make sure that you have bots available for every part of your server. That could either mean that you include them in global section of your server, you translate commands definitions in every language featured. Moderation: Since not all moderators will be able to understand every single language, using bots turn out to be very helpful for auto-moderation. Inform your fellow moderators about inappropriate words phrases ensure that you added them into bot filter for easier moderation. Banned filtered words should contain common slurs in not only English, but also in commonly banned words for every language that you offer. Language Barriers: It may occur that users message ModMail in poor English in their native language. Find out user's nationality reply with a message in their native language that lets them know their request is being routed to appropriately fluent mod. To save these messages, simply create an extra text-channel in ModMail server let moderators translate important phrases that might come in handy. Cultural Awareness It's easy for people to underestimate impact cultural differences can have. Culture influences values, rules, thought patterns, perception. That means that events happening in other countries may be viewed differently in each nation. News social media don't always portray truth which lets misinformation spread easily. Make sure to have your staff updated about current situations so they have it easier to deal with discussions about sensitive topics trolls. Communication is key users of server will massively benefit from it. While people are entitled to have their own opinion ask for further information, make sure to let it happen in a calm civil atmosphere under a moderatoras watch. If you as a moderator find that youare ill equipped to talk about topic, you should refrain from publicly voicing your opinion until youare better informed. Conversely, you may want to refrain from allowing contentious topics like current events politics to occur in your server at all, which is something you should decide with your moderation team as a whole. Final Words Making a server internationally available is a great idea can be a boon to your communityas retention. It can be utilized for both communities companies alike. But you have to be careful with your approach- Internationalization is a deliberate complicated process it should be treated as such. If itas gone about in wrong way, left uncompleted rushed, these international spaces could backfire. It may result in negative feedback, a disappointed community staff deserted channels. Make sure to inform your staff community about every step youare about to take, give them a chance to voice their input. Feedback suggestions from both your mods your community will be essential to making sure this is right fit for your server. Internationalization requires a lot of effort prioritization in order to properly take care of many factors simultaneously, but if done right, itas an unparalleled way to enrich your community. Training Onboarding New Moderators Training Methods Each server has to decide for themselves what most effective training method looks like. This article will present explain some recommended methods that can simplify moderation training. aBuddy Systema approach describes working in pairs groups, in which two more abuddiesa work together on one task. Requiring newer moderators to work with each other even an assigned team member allows you to better monitor progress for aid to come when required. It promotes active communication trust between moderators also allows them to keep an objective view on everything. Having multiple opinions about certain matters receiving assistance from a reliable source prevents moderators from feeling pressured with moderation tasks can even open your eyes to new viewpoints. Additionally, it allows its members to effectively share their moderation skills with each other. It also aids in terms of personal safety: if a moderator feels personally attacked by a user, they get immediate support from their abuddiesa without feeling need to tackle issue alone. A Using this system allows less experienced moderators to quickly effectively catch up to moderation standards as they learn how to deal with specific matters first hand. It is important to remind more experienced moderators on your team to allow new moderators to learn instead of wanting to quickly handle every task themselves. With time, certain actions will also become second nature for newer moderators, too! This approach is most commonly used when onboarding new moderators. Here experienced moderators head of staff introduce each new member of team personally guide them through most important aspects. difference between this system aBuddy Systema is that each new moderator will be acquainted with moderation tasks responsibilities by a higher up, usually only once. After walkthrough most recruits are expected to manage certain moderation duties on their own while being supervised. It is crucial to support reassure them so they are able to grow confident in their actions. Recruits can display appropriately train their soft skills be informed about moderation standards in a controlled environment without fear causing too much irreparable damage. Another method of efficiently training both experienced inexperienced moderators is by letting them regularly test their knowledge. This involves designing exemplary situations of some everyday issues happening within your Discord server to let trial moderators explain how they would handle them. Such instances can include how to handle issues in audio channels, user disputes, DM Discord invitations, off topic discussion in incorrect channel, potential issues that may be encountered with bots. At end you should provide some sort of amodela aexamplea answer to let recruits know where they need to improve. One negative effect of this system could be fear of failure that some inexperienced moderators might be exposed to. Reassure them that making mistakes is okay as long as you take responsibility for your actions are willing to learn from them. Moderation is an ever-shifting learned art, mistakes are not to be punished when they happen every once in a while.It may be tempting to conduct these regular exercises incognito (aka acting up on an alt to see how they do) test them without warning- while this may yield more aeverydaya unbiased results, it has a high probability of backfiring. Blindsiding your moderation team with tests exercises has potential to do more harm than good, especially in terms of team trust morale. Itas recommended that you donat do this instead, practice transparency when conducting regular exercises in order to avoid a potentially inequitable situation. Another form of training is to demonstrate how situations scenarios are handled in your community via presentation an actual demonstrative walk-through with moderation alt accounts. This is very useful for training where moderators have to use a wide range of commands, such as explaining moderation Modmail bots. Ideally, this should take place in an audio channel group call where you can share your screen. Not everyone is able comfortable joining a voice chat unmuting themselves, which is something to be considered beforehand. Training Program Content An essential part of onboarding new moderators is to have an easily accessible document outlining basic responsibilities details on moderator tasks different moderation teams. Such documents need to be designed for each server individually, but they usually contain general rules for staff, conduct expectations, a punishment outline to set a standard unity for moderation actions. Recommended additions to such a moderation handbook are: Be sure to recognize anything that is prevalent in your moderation culture community that is also worth mentioning here! more thorough guidelines, easier document is to refer back to for any questions. For example, gaming servers should have a brief description of featured gaming companyas Terms of Service discussion about how to handle cheaters users mentioning account sharing/selling in accordance with those rules. Another example would be for bot support servers where a brief description of commonly encountered issues how to solve them as well as an FAQ section to help users with simpler answers. Another important topic new moderators should have easy access to are commands for moderation bots. Having a simple guide in a separate text channel with a quick guide of botsa prefix format (command, user-id, [time], reason) will aid moderators in quickly responding to ongoing issues on server. It lets them react fast without having to pause to look up necessary command. Try to use same prefix for mainly used moderation bot to not cause unnecessary confusion, particularly for users who are new to moderating. Each server uses a differently designed service to assist moderators with helping out users. Bigger servers tend to rely on a ticket Modmail system, so properly introducing them with sample conversations problematic matters is essential for both recruit future user. Confident moderators are more willing to aid users in need than those who are still unsure of how system works. This kind of training should include commonly used commands procedures. There should be conversation about how to redirect users to higher staff closing tickets appropriately so they donat stack up cause confusion. As long as a ticket system remains organization those guidelines organizations are established across full team this will prove to be an easy to use communication system that is much less daunting than it may seem! Staff Safety No user should ever feel unsafe threatened on a Discord server. Staff members are often exposed to harmful disrespectful messages, some of them targeted at some moderators directly. An important aspect of onboarding moderators therefore is to make them aware of how to react in such situations. They need to be able to create an environment in which it is comfortable for them to work in not be afraid to ask for help if they feel threatened by users or, in extreme cases, other staff members. Staff members supporting each other being able to communicate in such moments is crucial for an effectively working team. Creating Managing a Training Program Effective management promotes a feeling of professionalism simplifies process of training new moderators by a lot. Important aspects that should always be covered when creating a training program are time management, deciding on which staff are involved in training why, effective communication, detailed content, flexibility. Choosing an appropriate approach. How do you want to introduce new members? What system did you conclude will work best for your server staff team? Never be afraid to evolve an already existing plan into something that suits better for your current situation. Deciding what topics to cover. What topics do you prioritize over others think require more time investment than others? How are you moderators handling learning process? Might there be anything in need of adjustment? Selecting voluntary participants. Having a reliable team behind you to assist you in training is of most importance. Everyone involved should be aware of what exactly they need to teach how to approach training within a reasonable time frame. Developing a timetable. Find common ground between everyone involved, including both mentors trainees, settle on when to teach what topic. Recommend tools to easily manage bigger teams are Google Docs similar, but bots self made timetables will suffice, too. Try to keep it simple easily accessible for everyone involved. Communication. Who responds to whom? Decide on how when mentors report to head of staff other higher ups. Documenting helps with ensuring everyone is aware of their part planning how to proceed further. Flexibility. No matter how carefully you plan everything out, it can always happen that something doesnat work according to plan. In such situations you need to be able to react spontaneously be flexible, such as pitching in for someone who is unable to attend due to a last minute shift in schedule. How to Deliver Effective Training Before conducting training, you should evaluate what can make your training most effective. Below you will find some best practices to set up a training program be able to atrain trainersa. Planning When you are giving a training, it is important to properly plan your training. What are most important topics to cover? What do you want new moderators to know after conducting training? How much time are you planning to spend on training? Some people struggle to focus for a longer period of time, so if your training takes over two hours, you should consider breaking your training up into multiple sessions of shorter duration. Make sure to accommodate for any accessibility issues notes for those who were unable to be present. Goals Each training should have objectives. You can create an outline of your training where you write down topics you will cover objective of that topic. For example, if you are training moderators to use Modmail, your objective is that new moderators are able to handle Modmail tickets use commands available to them. For each topic, also write down how you want to give this training: are you going to give a demonstration? Will you use illustrations? Will you offer new moderators to practice during your training get hands-on experience? Publicly sharing this with trainees can help keep you on topic allow them to come prepared with questions Practice After creating your training, make sure to practice it at least once. First, go through entire training yourself to see if everything is covered that you think is important. You can then give your training to someone on your team, in case you missed something important to check whether not your estimated time is accurate. If it is possible, go through material with someone who is unfamiliar with moderation. Adjust your training appropriately you are good to go! Interaction For every training session, it is very important to have interaction with your trainees. People lose their attention after 15-30 minutes, so your training should include a discussion, practice, some sort of interaction. Some of these interactive sessions are covered down below. Interaction with your trainees is also important because it acts as a way for you to verify whether not your objectives are properly conveyed. Make sure there is a break once every one to two hours so trainees can focus on your training without feeling overwhelmed. Methods Every training can consist of a combination of different training methods. These include, but are not limited to, lectures, quick exercises, group discussions, practice runs, quizzes, videos, demonstrations, more. When planning your training, you can write down what method would work best to convey objectives to your trainees. A group discussion will be better applicable to discuss moderation cases, where a demonstration practice would work better to demonstrate how Modmail bots work. Try mixing up multiple methods within a training to keep it fresh keep people from losing their attention. Preparation Preparation is key when you are giving any sort of training. Have quick notes ready with keywords that you are going to use during your training, so you do not lose track of where you are what objective you are trying to convey. If you need any material such as a presentation, paper pencil, example cases such, prepare them beforehand so you do not lose time during your training setting these up. If you use any material, test them beforehand. Donat forget to clear your schedule beforehand have some water ready if your training is mostly conducted over a voice chat call. It is important to sleep well night before feel confident. This will let you remain focused have an uninterrupted training session. Make sure you are ready at least five minutes before training starts to welcome arriving trainees as a final check whether not everything is ready good to go. If your training takes place in a voice chat call, test your microphone if you have a wireless headset, make sure it is charged up beforehand! Wrapping up your training When your training is done, finish with an exercise, group discussion, something else that is interactive fun to do. Ideally, this should summarize entire training. Have some room at end to answer any questions your trainees might have. Donat forget to thank everyone who participated for their active contributions! Evaluation After each training, write down what went well what could be improved. You can ask your trainees after they have had some experience as a moderator, what they missed during training that they think should be covered next time, as well as asking what information they did not find useful. You can then adjust your training for next time! Summary Having a training onboarding process in place is very important to have new moderators get accustomed with moderation culture, using bot commands, server rules, your moderation guidelines. There are several training methods that include buddy mentor systems as well as exercises demonstrations. A training document should outline most important information new moderators need, but prevent them from being overwhelmed with information they are unable to comprehend. To have efficient training in place, there are some very important aspects to consider, such as your preparation, goals, how you will carry out training of your new moderators, planning. Considering all of these things when creating your training process will make onboarding as informational effective as possible for you your new recruits! Reddit X Discord Does Your Subreddit Need a Discord? Discord communities are distinct from subreddits attract different audiences. While there are often overlaps between those audiences, it will not always be case, itas important to determine whether your community will benefit from having a Discord before you attempt to start one. Successful Discord communities revolve around human connections conversations not just content. For a Reddit community to translate well into a Discord community, it should be centered around a topic its members are passionate about are highly engaged with. To start, ask yourself following questions: If you believe answers to those questions would be negative about your community, it might be helpful to take a step back reconsider whether a Discord server would benefit it. Moderation Teams Typically, itas best to keep Reddit Discord moderation teams separate. Your Discord is a separate ecosystem with its own needs - itas important to find users from within it that will help you develop maintain it, make it flourish. When starting off, adding your existing subreddit moderator team usually works. However, itas important to note that those mods might not always be as dedicated to this new platform as they are to one that they came from. Looking into future for your Discord server, things might change subreddit mods that helped it in early days might end up having to take a backseat in favor of users who are brought in from within server. owner of server should be a dedicated mod from subreddit who knows both community inner-workings of Discord. Decisions made by owner will be critical to development of your server, so take a moment to review all of potential candidates within your team to choose best one for task. Make sure to bring in at least one user subreddit mod who is also as knowledgeable with Discord ecosystem familiar with your existing community to help with setup administration of server early on. You now have a bunch of mods! Mods on your subreddit, mods dedicated to your Discord server, mods that are both. But what do you do with all these mods, how do you tell them apart, what perms should they have? Communication between your different teams is key to success of both of your communities. Outside of owner, you should ideally have at least two other moderators that are present on both teams. These shared mods will be able to efficiently relay information between teams, coordinate collaborations between Reddit Discord communities, be able to take action in emergency situations, mediate conflicts if they occur. A Here are a few best practices: Itas important to be upfront to your community about fact that your subreddit Discord server are run moderated by completely separate mod teams after server starts taking shape. Set up escalation paths for both of your teams to direct issues related to your subreddit to Reddit modmail, vice-versa, direct users experiencing issues within server to its team. A All staff positions (except owner lead admins) should be independent of useras status on different moderation teams, you should remind your staff team that it is not a given to be modded elsewhere if you become a mod on either platform. Mods that participate in multiple teams must still uphold your activity requirements, meet all of your expectations similarly to rest of your team. Hosting Events Cross Promotions While your communities are linked together, theyare separate entities with different groups of regular visitors contributors. When considering cross platform promotions, assess their relevance to each of your audiences, determine whether they will find it helpful. A few best practices around this topic are: Closing notes Creating a Discord server can be a great way to broaden your subreddit-based community's horizons, giving your users a whole new way to interact with each other. However, it's important to remember that maintaining a Discord community can be a whole lot of work that some of your existing team members might not be interested in taking. Finding right person to lead your Discord ensuring your community's new outpost is in good hands early on will ensure a lasting smooth relationship between your subreddit Discord, to everyoneas benefit. Securing Your Discord Account Account Security first step towards securing server you moderate is securing your own Discord account. Your first line of defense is a strong unique password. Some characteristics of strong passwords include: You can also use a random password generator a password manager to create a completely random password that will be nearly impossible to guess, but difficult to remember. Another option is to combine several random words together. key, though, is that words need to be completely random. Using a tool to help select words at random from dictionary is a good way to help ensure their randomness. Once you have a strong password, you should also enable two-factor authentication, also known as 2FA. 2FA ensures that even if someone manages to guess your password, they wonat be able to get into your account without access to device where 2FA app is. You can also enable 2FA via SMS receive your authentication code via text message. However, SMS 2FA is less secure than application-based 2FA because text messages can be intercepted your phone number could be stolen. Although chance of this is still low, you should still avoid enabling SMS backup for this reason if possible. You also need to make sure devices where your Discord account is logged in device that has your 2FA app are physically secure. Make sure your computer is password protected locked when you are physically away from it. If you use a public computer, make sure that you use incognito mode on web browser to ensure that your Discord information is removed when you close browser. For a phone tablet, require a PIN code to unlock it so that it canat be used by strangers. Now that your account is nice secure, there is one more thing you must closely monitor to ensure it doesnat fall into wrong hands: yourself. Avoiding Social Engineering Attacks weakest link in any cybersecurity system is usually a human, security of your Discord account is no exception. Social engineering is use of deception to manipulate individuals into divulging confidential personal information that may be used for fraudulent purposes. People attempting to gain access to your Discord account may attempt to get you to log into a fake site, download a malicious file, click on a suspicious link. Being able to identify these actions avoiding potential pitfalls is an important part of keeping your account (and servers you moderate) safe. One of most common dangerous scams on Discord is a user a bot sending out a direct message with a QR code saying that you should scan QR code with Discordas QR code scanner for free nitro. This will generally be combined with instructions on how to access use Discordas QR code scanner. However, it is important to remember that Discord's QR code scanner is only used to log in to Discord. Scanning given QR code will allow that attacker to directly log into your account, bypassing your password any 2FA you may have configured. If you accidentally scan a suspicious QR code, you should immediately change your password as this will invalidate your current account token log you out of all devices.You can also report any such scams directly to Discord Trust Safety for further action. For more information on making reports, check out this article. Another common attack is to encourage you to click on a link that redirects to a fake Discord website. Before clicking on any links from a user, ask yourself following questions: If you find that answer to many of above questions is ayesa, you should avoid performing whatever action they are requesting. You can also check any suspicious-looking URLs with various URL checkers, such as this one. If user is specifically asking you to click on a link that prompts you to log in to Discord, another option you have is to navigate directly to https://discord.com in your web browser log in from there. If clicking on useras link still takes you to a login page, double check URL of website. One thing youall want to check is if website starts with https:// instead of http:, that there is a lock next to beginning of URL. Although some fake sites may still have an https:// designation, many of them will not. Other signs may be slight misspellings of URL visual tricks such as diiscrd.com dlscord.com with a lowercase ala instead of an aia. If you notice any of these signs, it is highly likely that it is not actually Discordas website instead a fake website intended to trick you into entering your login credentials so that it can steal your account. a Conclusion Creating a strong password, enabling 2FA, following best practices for physical device security are first steps towards keeping your Discord account secure. However, there may be people that try to trick you into giving access to your Discord account through various scams other social engineering attacks. Being able to spot suspicious messages users being cautious when encountering strange links files is another important part of keeping your account safe. Of course, anyone that is able to illicitly gain access to a moderator account on your server still has potential to do great harm, such as banning users deleting messages, channels, roles. Be sure to share this information with other moderators on your server so that you can each do your part to keep your community safe by keeping your accounts secure. Parasocial Relationships Definition A parasocial relationship describes a one-sided relationship between a spectator who develops a personal attachment through various influences to a performer who is not aware of existence of spectator. It is strengthened by continuous positive exposure to its source, which mainly happens on social platforms. Process In this section weall take a look at how parasocial relationships are developed how to establish severity of level of parasocial relationships you are encountering from a moderation standpoint. Development of Parasocial Relationships establishment of parasocial relationships can be portrayed as such: User A, in this example a popular content creator, uploads regular content on a big platform. User B, who takes position as a member of User Aas audience, takes an interest in their content. User B reacts to User Aas content observes them. While User A may know that people are enjoying their content, they are unlikely to be aware of every viewersa existence. This total awareness becomes more unlikely bigger audience gets. User B on other hand is regularly exposed to User Aas content takes a liking to them. interest is usually defined by User Aas online persona: content, visual appeal, likeability, even their voice can all be influencing aspects. User B perceives User A as very relatable through common interests behaviors starts to develop a feeling of loyalty, even responsibility, during that phase of one-sided bonding. This behavior can be attributed to personal reflection in User A, as well as psychological facts like loneliness, empathy, even low self-esteem. As a consequence, User B can easily be influenced by User A. At this point User B might feel like they understand User A in a way nobody else does may even begin to view them on a personal level as some sort of friend close relative. They see this individual every day, hear their voice on a regular basis, believe that they are connecting to them on a deep level. They develop an emotional attachment, stronger parasocial relationship gets, more attention User B pays to User Aas behavior mannerisms. While User A most likely doesnat know User B personally, User B will seek out interaction with recognition from User A. That behavior is typically represented through donations on stream, where User A either reads out their personal message name publishes a athank youa message on certain websites. Additionally, User B tries to follow engage with their idol on as many platforms as possible aside from their main source of content creation. These social media platforms are usually Instagram Twitter, but can also include User Aas Discord server. Levels of Parasocial Relationships While that type of relationship is natural sometimes even desired, it is important to define level of parasocial relationships differ between its intensity for safety of community, staff members, performer. In their article in Psychology focused academic journal aThe Psychologista, researchers Giles Maltby designed three levels of severity of parasocial relationships based on Celebrity Attitude Scale. aFans are attracted to a favourite celebrity because of their perceived ability to entertain to become a source of social interaction gossip. Items include aMy friends I like to discuss what my favourite celebrity has donea aLearning life story of my favourite celebrity is a lot of funa.a least harmful level is general public social presence. targeted celebrity is subjected to gossip mostly provides a source of entertainment. Their presence is mostly found in talks with friends, talk shows, on magazine covers, similar public-facing media. Discord users on this level usually interact with community in a relaxed, harmless way. next level is parasocial interaction. characteristics of this level are development of an emotional attachment of a spectator with a performer, resulting in intense feelings. This behavior is characterized by spectator wanting to get to know performer, followed by desire to be part of their life as well as considering them as part of their own life. A result of that can be addictive even obsessive behavior, which can be noticed in Discord servers, too. aThe intense-personal aspect of celebrity worship reflects intensive compulsive feelings about celebrity, akin to obsessional tendencies of fans often referred to in literature. Items include aMy favourite celebrity is practically perfect in every waya aI consider my favourite celebrity to be my soulmatea.a Spectators of that level usually ping performer message them privately in an attempt to be recognized. While that behavior is natural, anything that endangers safe interactions between themselves, community, performer needs to be supervised carefully. Unrestrained abusive behavior, which can be found in unwanted intimate, borderline NSFW questions comments, needs to be addressed corrected accordingly. final level is considered most intense level also most dangerous. It contains severe, harmful obsessions that can extend all way to stalking real-world consequences. Parasocial relationships to this degree will rarely be found on Discord, but have to immediately be reported if present. aThis dimension is typified by uncontrollable behaviours fantasies about their celebrities. Items include aI would gladly die in order to save life of my favourite celebritya aIf I walked through door of my favourite celebrityas house she he would be happy to see mea.a vast majority of users wonat reach level past seeing performer as a source of entertainment, but moderators should be aware of potential consequences of anything beyond that as they can be harmful to both spectator, performer, safe environment you are working to upkeep for all. Parasocial Relationships on Discord Parasocial relationships on Discord can pertain to anyone who is perceived as being popular influential, making them acelebritiesa of Discord. Some examples of parasocial relationships on Discord can be found between a user a moderator, a user a content creator you are moderating for, even a member of your moderation team content creator you are working for. But what does all that mean for you, mod? While Discord moderators are not nearly as popular influential as big content creators celebrities, they are still observed by Discord users. While being a moderator puts you into a position of power responsibility over wellbeing of server, some users perceive it as you climbing social ladder in Discord server. In their eyes, becoming a moderator changes your overall social status within your Discord community. Being hoisted higher in serversa hierarchy results in members quickly recognizing you potentially treating you differently due to your influence, even becoming afansa of you as a person. Some users will soak up any information they can get about you, especially if they realize that you have common interests. This may lead to development of a parasocial relationship between users you. Users you have never interacted with before might see you as a person they would get along with seek out your attention, leading to a one-sided relationship on their part. Having such an audience can be overwhelming at first. People will start to look up to you, younger users especially can easily be influenced by online personas. They might adapt to your behavior even copy your mannerisms. Knowing that, you should always be self-aware of your actions etiquette in public to promote a healthy, sustainable relationship with users. Receiving special attention from users can quickly influence spiral into developing an arrogant, entitled attitude. There is nothing wrong with being proud of your position accomplishments, but being overtly arrogant will influence a membersa behavior towards you. mindset of one user deciding a moderator is not being responsible can spread through community in negative ways. They might belittle you in front of new members give them feeling that you wonat be there to help them might not inform you of ongoing problems on server during a temporary absence of moderators in chat. A healthy user-moderator relationship is important to prevent stop ongoing raids as well as make moderators aware of a user misbehaving in chat. Additionally, itas important to be mindful that your perceived fame does not start to negatively influence your judgment. For example, you may find yourself giving special attention to those who seem to appreciate you while treating users that are indifferent towards your position as a moderator more harshly. It also causes dynamics within staff team to change as fellow moderators might start to perceive you differently if you begin to allow bias to seep into moderation. They may start to second guess your decisions, feel need to check up on your moderator actions, even lose trust in your capabilities. If you ever notice that you experience said effect, notice one of your fellow moderators is experiencing it letting it consume them, be supportive sort out negative changes. When confronting another moderator about it, make sure to do it through constructive criticism that doesnat seem like a personal attack. In spite of that, effects of parasocial relationships donat always have to be negative in nature. If users manage to build such a connection to a moderation team, general server atmosphere can grow positively. Users know what moderators like donat enjoy, which will lead them to behave in a way that appeals to staff usually abides by server rules. They will also be able to predict a moderatorsa reaction to certain behavior messages new people might use. As a result, they will attempt to correct users that are mildly misbehaving themselves without getting staff involved immediately in hopes of receiving positive feedback from staff. Naturally, moderators wonat be able to know of every single person that tries to appeal to them through those actions, but once they are aware that such things happen in certain text channels, it will give them opportunity to focus on other channels provide their assistance there. As mentioned before: In case of content creators who frequently upload videos, streams, other forms of media for their followers, chance of a parasocial phenomenon being developed can be even greater. This will only intensify by joining a creatorsa Discord server. This can be done under false assumption that there will be a higher chance of their messages being read noticed. Your responsibility as a moderator is to neither weaken that bond nor encourage it while providing security for users, staff, content creator. Let users interact in a controlled environment while maintaining privacy of content creator. Some users might even feel like content creator owes them some sort of recognition after long-term support, both through engagement donations. Such a demand can be intensified when theyare shown as ahighera in hierarchy through dedicated Discord roles, such as Patreon/Donator simple activity roles. In case of multiple people building a parasocial relationship with same content creator experiencing that phenomenon, they may see other active users even moderators as arivals.a They see content creator as a close friend in their eyes feel threatened that others, especially those that financially support content creator, perceive them same think they are even closer to them. During such moments, it is recommended to keep peace between users let them know that content creator appreciates every fan they have. While ones providing financial support are appreciated, every viewer is what makes creator as big as they are played a part in getting them to where they are today. Maybe it wonat only be user that feels closer to them by joining server. Many beginner moderators may also find themselves feeling as though they are above rest of community because their idol has entrusted them with power on their server. Being closer to them than most of users can easily fog your judgement; it is essential to prioritize being friendly respectful to users over these personal convictions. When adding moderators to your moderation team, it is important to keep an eye out for this kind of behavior to combat it, to hold your teammates accountable should you see this behavior begin to exhibit in one of your teammates. Making sure your entire team is on same page regarding your duties standing in community is essential to maintaining a healthy moderation environment. As a moderator for a Content Creator, this individual you may admire deeply has put their trust in you to keep their community safe. Falling into machinations of developing an unhealthy parasocial relationship with them directly interferes with your ability to do that, failing not only community but creator. In Conclusion Despite potential dangers from parasocial relationships, fact that they develop at all may indicate that you are doing a good job as a moderator. While positive attention appreciation are key factors to a healthy development, not everyone may like that sort of attention it is completely acceptable to tell your fellow moderators even users themselves about it. At one point you might feel like you reached your limit need a break from moderation managing parasocial relationships aimed at you those around you. Moderator burnout is very real, you should not hesitate to take a break when you need it. Users will view you, as a moderator, as a leader that helps guide your designated Discord server in right direction. As such, you will be a target for rude comments by users that have personal issues with server while simultaneously getting showered with affection by other users who are thankful for what you do for server. Never be afraid to ask for help rely on moderation team if things go too far for your personal boundaries comfort level, even if you are an experienced moderator. Establishing a healthy relationship with community is important, but being able to trust your fellow staff members is even more so. Nobody expects you to build an intimate relationship with every member, but knowing you can count on them their support is essential for team to function correctly. Transparency in Moderation Pros Cons of Transparency While there are certain abest practicesa when it comes to moderation transparency, there is no single system that is right for everyone. amount of transparency you need for your moderation system ultimately depends on your server rules, culture, vision. This article will explain pros cons of transparency ways that you can apply transparency to your moderation system. Though idea of moderation transparency is generally considered to be a good thing, it is important to understand that there are both pros cons to transparency in moderation. Some of these pros cons are described below. To help you understand how pros cons apply to transparency, consider an example in which a moderator publicly warns another user not to call someone a aretarda because it violates an existing aNo Slurs Alloweda rule. Moderation System Now that you are aware of some of pros cons of transparency in moderation, you must next understand components of moderation system so that you can consider ways in which these components can be made more less transparent. Broadly speaking, a moderation system can be split into following components: Transparency communication go hand-in-hand. more you communicate these components to relevant users server as a whole, more transparent your moderation system is. Implementing Transparency There are several ways to implement transparency in each of these components, each with their own pros cons. Each section here will establish ways in which a component can be made more less transparent a recommendation of appropriate level of transparency for each. However, please keep in mind that every serveras needs are different some of pros cons discussed may not apply to your server. It is always important to consider your specific community when it comes to implementing transparency. Your server rules are backbone of your moderation system. They describe how your members should conduct themselves what happens if they donat meet those expectations. In general though, your rules should be specific enough to ensure comprehension compliance without being overly wordy attempting to provide an exhaustive description of prohibited behaviors. For example, giving a couple of examples of NSFW content for a ano NSFW content rulea may help people understand what you interpret as being NSFW, compared to other servers Discord itself. However, too many examples may make list seem fully comprehensive, people will assume that items not on list are fair game. Disclaiming that examples of rule-breaking content are non-exhaustive that moderators have final say in interpreting if someone is breaking rules can help to address users that are interested in testing limits of rules being rules lawyers to escape punishment on a technicality. Developing moderator guidelines is another important part of your moderation system. Similar to your rules guiding conduct of your server members, your moderator guidelines help guide conduct of your moderators. Keeping your moderator guidelines visible to rest of server will encourage compliance from members, enable them to defuse incidents without moderator intervention. Furthermore, providing basic standards of moderator conduct will help users know when itas appropriate to report moderators to server owner for misconduct hold them accountable. However, you should avoid putting too much of your moderator guidelines out in public in order to avoid rules lawyers deliberately misinterpreting spirit of guidelines to their advantage. After developing your moderator guidelines, balancing these pros cons will help you determine how much of your guidelines you should present to public. Logging user infractions is key to ensuring that entire moderation team has same understanding of how often a user has broken rules. Transparency between mod team user in question is important for user to understand when they have received a warning that brings them closer to being banned from server. Informing user of which moderator warned them is important for holding moderators accountable to warnings they issue, but may leave moderators open to harassment by warned users. Having a procedure to deal with harassment that stems from this, is one way to achieve accountability while still protecting your moderators from bad actors in your server. Although communication of infractions is vital to ensure understanding among your server members, it may be prudent to withhold information about exactly how close a user is to being banned so that they do not attempt to toe line by staying just under threshold for being banned. Furthermore, even though a public infraction log may be a good way to promote cohesion transparency by showing examples of unacceptable behavior to rest of server fostering discussion between mod team community, others may think that such a log infringes on user privacy that these logs may constitute a awitch hunt.a It may also leave mods users open to harassment over warnings given received. If you want to encourage a sense of community understanding without taking away user privacy inadvertently encouraging harassment, a better option may be to encourage users to bring up criticisms of rules enforcement in a feedback channel if they wish to. Provided that mod team ensures these conversations remain constructive civil, creating a public medium for these conversations will help others understand how mod team operates allow them to provide feedback on how server is run. Everyone makes mistakes, moderators are no exception. It is important to have a process for users to appeal their warnings punishments if they feel that they were issued unfairly. If you decide to have a public infractions log, you may receive appeals on behalf of warned users from people who were uninvolved in situation if they feel warning was issued unfairly. While this can help with accountability if a user is too nervous to try to appeal their warning, it can also waste time of your mod team by involving someone that does not have a complete understanding of situation. In general, it is better to keep appeal process private between moderation team punished user, primarily via mediums such as direct messages with an administrator through a mod mail bot. During appeal process, it is best to ensure that you clearly calmly walk through situation with appealing user to help them better understand rules while maintaining moderator accountability. Summary In end, there is not a single acorrecta way to manage transparency in your moderation system. appropriate level of transparency will vary based on size of server rules that you implement. However, walking through steps of your moderation system one by one considering various pros cons of transparency will help you determine for yourself how to incorporate transparency into your moderation system. This will help you build trust between moderators non-moderators while preventing abuse on both ends of system. Auto Moderation in Discord Why is Auto Moderation important? Auto Moderation is integral to many communities on Discord, especially those of any notable size. There are many valid reasons for this, some of which you may find apply to your community as well. security that auto moderation can provide can give your users a much better experience in your community, make lives of your moderators easier prevent malicious users from doing damage to your community even joining your community. If youare a well established community, youall likely have a moderation team in place. You may wonder, why should I use auto moderation? I already have moderators! Auto moderation isnat a replacement for manual moderation, rather, it serves to enrich it. Your moderation team can continue to make informed decisions within your community while auto moderation serves to make that process easier for them by responding to common issues at any time more quickly than a real-life moderator can. Different communities will warrant varying levels of auto moderation. Itas important to be able to classify your community consider what level of auto moderation is most suitable to your communityas needs. Keep in mind that Discord does impose some additional guidelines depending on how you designate your community. Below are different kinds of communities their recommended auto moderation systems: If you run a Discord community with limited invites where every new member is known, auto moderation wonat be a critical function unless you have a significantly larger member count. Itas recommended to have at least some auto moderation however, namely text filters, anti-spam, Discordas AutoMod keyword filters. If you run a Discord community that is Discoverable has public invites where new members can come from just about anywhere, itas strongly recommended to have anti-spam text filters Discordas AutoMod keyword filters in place. Additionally, you should be implementing some level of member verification to facilitate server onboarding process. If your community is large, with several thousand members, anti-raid functionality may become necessary. Remember, auto moderation is configurable to your rules, as strict loose as they may be, so keep this principle in mind when deciding what level of automation works best for you. If your Discord community is Verified Partnered, you will need to adhere to additional guidelines to maintain that status. Auto moderation is recommended for these communities in order to feel confident that you can succinctly effectively enforce these guidelines at all times so consider using anti-spam text filters Discordas AutoMod keyword filters. If you have a Vanity URL your community is Discoverable, anti-raid is a must-have in order to protect your community from malicious actors. Built-in moderation features Some of most powerful tools in auto moderation come with your community are built directly into Discord. Located under Server Settings tab, you will find Moderation settings. This page houses some of strongest safety features that Discord has to natively offer. These settings can help secure your Discord community without elaborate setup of a third party bot involved. individual settings will be detailed below. AutoMod AutoMod is a new content moderation feature as of 2022, allowing those with aManage Servera aAdministratora permissions to set up keyword spam filters that can automatically trigger moderation actions such as blocking messages that contain specific keywords spam from being posted, logging flagged messages as alerts for you to review. This feature has a wide variety of uses within realm of auto moderation, allowing mods to automatically log malicious messages protect community members from harm exposure to undesirable spam words like slurs severe profanity. AutoModas abilities also extend to messages within threads, text-in-voice channels, Forum channels giving moderation teams peace of mind that they have AutoModas coverage across these message surfaces without having to worry about adding more manual moderation work by enabling these valuable features. Setting up AutoMod is very straightforward. First, make sure your server has Communities enabled. Then, navigate to your serveras settings click AutoMod tab. From there, youall find AutoMod can start setting up keyword spam filters.a Keyword Filtersa Keyword filters allow you to flag block messages containing specific words, characters, symbols from being posted. You can set up one aCommonly Flagged Wordsa filter, along with up to 3 custom keyword filters that allow you to enter a maximum of 1,000 keywords each, for a total of four keyword filters. When inserting keywords, you should separate each word with a comma like so: Bad, words, go, here. Matches for keywords are exact aware of whitespace. For example, keyword aTest Filtera will be triggered by atest filtera but not atestfiltera atesta. Do note that keywords also ignore capitalisation. To have AutoMod filter messages containing words that partially match your keywords, which is helpful for preventing users from circumventing your filters, you can modify your keywords with asterisk (*) wildcard character. This works as follows: Be careful with wildcards so as to not have AutoMod incorrectly flag words that are acceptable commonly used! AutoModas Commonly Flagged Words keyword filter comes equipped with three predefined wordlists that provide communities with convenient protection against commonly flagged words. There are three predefined categories of words available: Insults Slurs, Sexual Content, Severe Profanity. These wordlists will all share one rule, meaning theyall all have same response configured. These lists are maintained by Discord can help keep conversations in your Community consistent with Discord's Community Guidelines. This can be particularly helpful for Partnered Verified communities. a Both AutoModas commonly flagged word filters custom filters allow for exemptions in form of roles channels, with commonly flagged word filter also allowing for exemption of words from Discordas predefined wordlists. Anyone with these defined roles, sending messages within defined channels containing keywords from Discordas wordlists, will not trigger responses from AutoMod.This is notably useful for allowing moderators to bypass filters, allowing higher trusted users to send more unrestricted messages, tailoring commonly flagged wordlists to your communityas needs. As an example, you could prevent new users from sending Discord invites with a keyword filter of: *discord.gg/*, *discord.com/invites/* then give an exemption to moderators users who have a certain role, allowing them to send Discord invites. This could also be used to only allow sharing Discord invites in a specific channel. Thereas a lot of potential use cases for exemptions! Members with Manage Server Administrator permissions will always be exempt from all AutoMod filters. Bots webhooks are also exempt. Spam, by definition, is irrelevant unsolicited messages. AutoMod comes equipped with two spam filters that allow you to flag messages containing mention spam content spam. Mention spam is when users post messages containing excessive mentions for purpose of disrupting your server unnecessarily pinging others. AutoModas mention spam filter lets you flag block messages containing an excessive number of unique @role @user mentions. You define what is aexcessivea by setting a limit on number of unique mentions that a message may contain, up to 50. It is recommended to select ""Block message"" as an AutoMod response when it detects a message containing excessive mentions as this prevents notifications from being sent out to tagged users roles. This helps prevent your channels from being clogged up by disruptive messages containing mention spam during mass mention attempts mention raids, saves your members from annoyance of getting unnecessary notifications ghost pings. a This filter identifies spam at large by using a model that has been trained by messages that users have reported as spam to Discord. Enabling this filter is an effective way to block out a variety of messages that resemble spammy content reported by Discord users, identify spammers in your community that should be weeded out. However, this filter isnat perfect might not catch all forms of spam, such as DM spam, copy/pasta repeat messages. You can configure AutoModas keyword spam filters with following automatic responses when a message is flagged: This response will prevent a message containing a keyword spam from being sent entirely. Users will be notified with an ephemeral message when this happens, informing them community has blocked message from being sent. Discord will seamlessly block all messages containing matching keywords, spam content, excessive mentions from your filters from being sent entirely regardless of volume of messages, making this response especially effective for preventing de-escalating raids where raiders try to spam your channels with repeated messages excessive mentions. This response will send an alert containing who-what-where information of a flagged message to a logging channel of your choice. This message will preview what full caught message wouldave looked like, including full content. It also shows a pair of buttons at bottom of message, a Actions Report Issues. Thes action buttons will bring up a user context menu, allowing you to use any permissions you have to kick, ban time out member. message also displays channel message was attempted to be sent in filter that was triggered by message. In future, some auto-moderation bots may be able to detect these messages action users accordingly. a This response will automatically apply a time out penalty to a user, preventing them from interacting in server for duration of penalty. Affected users are unable to send messages, react to messages, join voice channels video calls during their timeout period. Keep in mind that they are able to see messages being sent during this period. To remove a timeout penalty, Moderators Admins can right-click on any offending useras name to bring up their Profile Context Menu select aRemove Timeout.a AutoMod is a very powerful tool that you can set up easily to reduce moderation work keep your community's channels conversations clean welcoming during all hours of day. For example, you may want to use three keyword filters; one to just block messages, one to just send alerts for messages, one to do both. Overall, it's recommended to have AutoMod block messages you wouldn't want community members to see. For example, high harm keywords such as slurs other extreme language should have AutoModas ablock messagea asend alertsa responses enabled. This will allow your moderation team to take action against undesirable messages users behind them while preventing rest of your community from exposure. Low harm keywords commonly spammed phrases can also have AutoModas aBlock messagea response enabled without need to set up alerts. This will still prevent undesirable messages from being sent without spamming your logs with alerts. You can also quickly configure AutoModas keyword spam filters in real-time to prevent de-escalate raids by adding spammed keywords - adjusting your mention limit in event of a mention raid - to prevent raids from causing lasting damage. It's also recommended to have AutoMod send you alerts for more subjective content that requires a closer look from your moderation team, rather than having them being blocked entirely. This will allow your moderation team to investigate flagged messages with additional context to ensure thereas nothing malicious going on. This is useful for keywords that can be commonly misrepresented, sent in a non-malicious context. a Verification Level None - This turns off verification for your community, meaning anyone can join immediately interact with your community. This is typically not recommended for public communities as anyone with malicious intent can immediately join wreak havoc. Low - This requires people joining your community to have a verified email which can help protect your community from laziest of malicious users while keeping everything simple for well-meaning users. This would be a good setting for a small, private community. Medium - This requires user to have a verified email address for their account to be at least 5 minutes old. This further protects your community by introducing a blocker for people creating accounts solely to cause problems. This would be a good setting for a moderately sized community small public community. High - This includes same protections as both medium low verification levels but also adds a 10 minute barrier between someone joining your community being able to interact. This can give you anyone else responsible for keeping things clean in your community time to respond to araidsa, large numbers of malicious users joining at once. For legitimate users, you can encourage them to do something with this 10 minute time period such as read rules familiarize themselves with informational channels to pass time until waiting period is over. This would be a good setting for a large public community. Highest - This requires a joining user to have a verified phone number in addition to above requirements. This setting can be bypassed by robust araidersa, but it takes additional effort. This would be a good setting for a private community where security is tantamount, a public community with custom verification. This requirement is one many normal Discord users wonat fill, by choice inability. Itas worth noting that Discordas phone verification disallows VoIP numbers to be abused. Explicit media content filter Not everyone on internet is sharing content with best intentions in mind. Discord provides a robust system to scan images embeds to make sure inappropriate images donat end up in your community. There are varying levels of scrutiny to explicit media content filter which are: Donat scan any media content - Nothing sent in your community will go through Discordas automagical image filter. This would be a good setting for a small, private community where only people you trust can post images, videos etc. Scan media content from users without a role - Self explanatory, this works well to stop new users from filling your community with unsavoury imagery. When combined with proper verification methods, this would be a good setting for a moderately sized private public community. Scan media content from all members - This setting makes sure everyone, regardless of their roles, isnat posting unsavoury things in your community. In general, we recommend this setting for ALL public facing communities. Once youave decided on base level of auto moderation you want for your community, itas time to look at extra levels of auto moderation bots can bring to table! next few sections are going to detail ways in which a bot can moderate. Bot-controlled Auto Moderation If you want to keep your chats clean clear of certain words, phrases, spam, mentions everything else that can be misused by malicious users youare going to need a little help from a robotic friend two. Examples of bots that are freely available are referenced below. If you decide to use several bots, you may need to juggle several moderation systems. When choosing a bot for auto moderation, you should also consider their capabilities for manual moderation (things like managing mutes, warns etc.). Find a bot with an infraction/punishment system you rest of your moderator team find to be most appropriate. All of bots listed in this article have a manual moderation system. main most pivotal forms of auto moderation are: Each of these subsets of auto moderation will be detailed below along with recommended configurations depending on your community. Itas important your auto moderation bot(s) of choice are adopting cutting edge of Discord API features, as this will allow them to provide better capabilities integrate more powerfully with Discord. Slash commands are especially important as youare able to configure which commands are usable on which bot on a case by case basis for each slash command. This will allow you to maintain very detailed moderation permissions for your moderation team. Bots that support more recent API features are generally also considered to be more actively developed, thus more reliable in regards to reacting to new threat vectors as well as able to adapt to new features on Discord. A severely outdated bot could react insufficiently to a high-harm situation. a As mentioned above, one of more recent features is Slash Commands. Slash commands are configurable per-command, per-role, per-channel. This allows you to designate moderation commands solely to your moderation team without relying on permissions on botas side to work perfectly. This is relevant because there have been documented examples in past of permissions being bypassed on a moderation botas permission checking, allowing normal users to execute moderation commands. a One of most common forms of auto moderation is anti-spam, a type of filter that can detect prevent various kinds of spam. Depending on what bot(s) youare using, this comes with various levels of configurability. One of most common forms of auto moderation is anti-spam, a type of filter that can detect prevent various kinds of spam. Depending on what bot(s) youare using, this comes with various levels of configurability. Anti-spam is integral to running a large private community, a public community. There are multiple types of spam a user can engage in, with some of most common forms listed in table above. These types of spam messages are also very typical of raids, especially Fast Messages Repeated Text. While spam can largely be defined as irrelevant unsolicited messages, nature of spam can vary greatly. However, vast majority of instances involve a user users sending lots of messages with same content with intent of disrupting your community. There are subsets of this spam that many anti-spam filters will be able to catch. For example, if any of following: Mentions, Links, Invites, Emoji Newline Text are spammed repeatedly in one message, spammed repeatedly across several messages, they will provoke most Repeated Text Fast Messages filters appropriately. Subset filters are still a good thing for your anti-spam filter to have as you may wish to punish more less harshly depending on spam. Notably, Emoji Links may warrant separate punishments. Spamming 10 links in a single message is inherently worse than having 10 emoji in a message. Anti-spam will only act on these things contextually, usually in an X in Y fashion where if a user sends, for example, ten links in five seconds, they will be punished to some degree. This could be ten links in one message, one link in ten messages. In this respect, some anti-spam filters can act simultaneously as Fast Messages Repeated Text filters. Sometimes, spam may happen too quickly a bot can fall behind. There are rate limits in place to stop bots from harming communities that can prevent deletion of individual messages if those messages are being sent too quickly. This can often happen in raids. As such, Fast Messages filters should prevent offenders from sending messages; this can be done via a mute, kick ban. If you want to protect your community from raids, please read on to Anti-Raid section of this article. Text filters allow you to control types of words and/or links that people are allowed to put in your community. Different bots will provide various ways to filter these things, keeping your chat nice clean. A text filter is a must for a well moderated community. Itas strongly recommended you use a bot that can filter text based on a banlist. A Banned words filter can catch links invites provided http:// https:// are added to word banlist (for all links) specific full site URLs to block individual websites. In addition, discord.gg can be added to a banlist to block ALL Discord invites. A Banned Words filter is integral to running a public community, especially for Partnered, Community, Verified servers who have additional content guidelines they must meet that a Banned Words filter can help with. Before configuring a filter, itas a good idea to work out what is isnat ok to say in your community, regardless of context. For example, racial slurs are generally unacceptable in almost all communities, regardless of context. Banned word filters often wonat account for context with an explicit banlist. For this reason, itas also important that a robust filter contains allowlisting options. For example, if you add acata to your filter someone says acatcha, they could get in trouble for using an otherwise acceptable word. Filter immunity may also be important to your community as there may be individuals who need to discuss use of banned words, namely members of a moderation team. There may also be channels that allow usage of otherwise banned words. For example, a serious channel dedicated to discussion of real world issues may require discussions about slurs other demeaning language, in this exception channel based Immunity is integral to allowing those conversations. Link filtering is important to communities where sharing links in agenerala chats isnat allowed, where there are specific channels dedicated to sharing that content. This can allow a community to remove links with an appropriate reprimand without treating that misstep with same gravity one would someone who used a slur. Allow/ban-listing templates for links are also a good idea to have. While many communities will use catch-all filters to make sure links stay in specific channels, some links will always be inherently unsavory. Being able to filter specific links is a good feature- with preset filters (like google filter provided by YAGPDB) coming in very handy for protecting your user base without requiring intricate setup on your behalf. However, it is recommended you configure a custom filter as a supplement, to ensure specific slurs, words, etc. that break rules of your community, arenat being said. Invite filtering is equally important in large public communities where users will attempt to raid, scam otherwise assault your community with links with intention of manipulating your user base where unsolicited self-promotion is potentially fruitful. Filtering allows these invites to be recognized instantly dealt with more harshly. Some bots may also allow by-community white/banlisting allowing you to control which communities are approved to share invites to which arenat. A good example of invite filtering usage would be something like a partners channel, where invites to other, closely linked, communities are shared. These communities should be added to an invite allowlist to prevent their deletion. Discord also implements a native filter on links files, though this filter is entirely client-side doesnat prevent malicious links files being sent. It does, however, warn users who attempt to click suspicious links download suspicious files (executables, archives etc.) prevents known malicious links from being clicked at all. While this doesnat remove offending content, shouldnat be relied on as auto moderation, it does prevent some cracks in your auto moderation from harming users. Raids, as defined earlier in this article, are mass-joins of users (often selfbots) with intent of damaging your community. Protecting your community from these raids can come in various forms. One method involves gating your server using a method detailed elsewhere in DMA. Raid detection means a bot can detect large number of users joining thatas typical of a raid, usually in an X in Y format. This feature is usually chained with Raid Prevention Damage Prevention to prevent detected raid from being effective, wherein raiding users will typically spam channels with unsavory messages. Raid-user detection is a system designed to detect users who are likely to be participating in a raid independently of quantity of frequency of new user joins. These systems typically look for users that were created recently have no profile picture, among other triggers depending on how elaborate system is. Raid prevention stops a raid from happening, either by Raid detection Raid-user detection. These countermeasures stop participants of a raid specifically from harming your community by preventing raiding users from accessing your community in first place, such as through kicks, bans, mutes of users that triggered detection. Damage prevention stops raiding users from causing any disruption via spam to your community by closing off certain aspects of it either from all new users, from everyone. These functions usually prevent messages from being sent read in public channels that new users will have access to. This differs from Raid Prevention as it doesnat specifically target remove new users in community. Raid anti-spam is an anti-spam system robust enough to prevent raiding usersa messages from disrupting channels via typical spam found in a raid. For an anti-spam system to fit this dynamic, it should be able to prevent Fast Messages Repeated Text. This is a subset of Damage Prevention. Raid cleanup commands are typically mass-message removal commands to clean up channels affected by spam as part of a raid, often aliased to aPurgea aPrunea.Built-in anti-raid It should be noted that Discord features built-in raid user bot detection, which is rather effective at preventing raids as before they happen. If you are logging member joins leaves, you can infer that Discord has taken action against shady accounts if time difference between join leave times is extremely small (such as between 0-5 seconds). However, you shouldnat rely solely on these systems if you run a large public community. Messages arenat only way potential evildoers can introduce unwanted content to your community. They can also manipulate their Discord username Nickname to be abusive. There are a few different ways a username can be abusive different bots offer different filters to prevent this. Username filtering is less important than other forms of auto moderation. When choosing which bot(s) to use for your auto moderation needs, this should typically be a later priority, since users with malicious usernames can just be nicknamed in order to hide their actual username. Specialized Auto Moderation Bots So far, weave covered general auto moderation bots with a wide toolset. However, there are some specialized bots that only cover one specific facet of auto moderation execute it especially well. A few examples descriptions are below: This bot detects raids as they happen globally, banning raiders from your community. This is especially notable as itall ban detected raiders from raids in other communities itas in as they join your community, making it significantly more effective than other anti-raid solutions that only pay attention to your community. Fish is designed to counter scamming links accounts, targeting patterns in joining users to prevent DM raids (Like normal raids, but members are directly messaged instead). These DM raids are typically phishing scams, which Fish also filters, deleting known phishing sites. Both of these bots are highly specialized link file moderation bots, effectively filtering adult sites, scamming sites other categories of sites as defined by your moderation team. Which bot do I use? When choosing a bot for auto moderation you should ensure it has an infraction/punishment system you your mod team are comfortable with as well as its features being whatas best suited for your community. Consider testing out several bots their compatibility with Discordas built-in auto moderation features to find what works best for your serveras needs. You should also keep in mind that list of bots in this article is not comprehensive - you can consider bots not listed here. world of Discord moderation bots is vast fascinating, we encourage you to do your own research! For largest of communities, itas recommended you employ everything Discord has to offer. You should use High Highest Verification level, all of Discordas AutoMod keyword filters a robust moderation bot like Gearbot Gaius. You should seriously consider additional bots like Fish, Beemo Safelink/Crosslink to aid in keeping your users safe have detailed Content Moderation filters. At this scale, you should seriously consider premium, self hosted, custom moderation bots to meet unique demands of your community. Itas recommended you use a bot with a robust diverse toolset, while simultaneously utilizing AutoModas commonly flagged word filters. You should use High Verification level to aid in preventing raids. If raiding isnat a large concern for your community, Gearbot Giselle are viable options. Your largest concerns in a community of this size is going to be anti-spam text filters meaning robust keyword filters are also highly recommended, with user filters as a good bonus. Beemo is generally recommended for any servers of this size. At this scale a self hosted, custom, premium bot may also be a viable option, but such bots arenat covered in this article. Itas recommended you use Fire, Gearbot, Bulbbot, AutoModerator Giselle. Mee6 Dyno are also viable options, however as theyare very large bots have been known to experience outages, leaving your community unprotected for large amounts of time. At this community size, youare likely not going to be largely concerned about anti-raid with anti-spam text filters being your main focus. Youall likely be able to get by just using AutoModas keyword filters commonly flagged words lists provided by Discord. User filters, at this size, are largely unneeded your Verification Level shouldnat need to be any higher than Medium. If your community is small private, likelihood of malicious users joining to wreak havoc is rather low. As such, you can choose a bot with general moderation features you like most use that for auto moderation. Any of bots listed in this article should serve this purpose. At this scale, you should be able to rely solely on AutoModas keyword filters. Your Verification Level is largely up to you at this scale depending on where you anticipate member growth coming from, with Medium being default recommended. Configuring Auto Moderation for listed bots Mee6 First, make sure Mee6 is in communities you wish to configure it for. Then log into its online dashboard (https://mee6.xyz/dashboard/), navigate to community(s), then plugins enable aModeratora plugin. Within settings of this plugin are all auto moderation options. Dyno First, make sure Dyno is in communities you wish to configure it for. Then log into its online dashboard (https://dyno.gg/account), navigate to community(s), then aModulesa tab. Within this tab, navigate to aAutomoda you will find all auto moderation options. Giselle First, make sure Giselle is in communities you wish to configure it for. Then, look at its documentation (https://docs.gisellebot.com/) for full details on how to configure auto moderation for your community. AutoModerator First, make sure Gaius is in communities you wish to configure it for. Then, look at its documentation (https://automoderator.app/docs/setup/) for full details on how to configure auto moderation for your community. Fire First, make sure Fire is in communities) you wish to configure it for. Then, look at its documentation (https://getfire.bot/commands) for full details on how to configure auto moderation for your community. Bulbbot First, make sure Bulbbot is in communities you wish to configure it for. Then, look at its documentation (https://docs.bulbbot.rocks/getting-started/) for full details on how to configure auto moderation for your community. Gearbot First, make sure Gearbot is in communities you wish to configure it for. Then, look at its documentation (https://gearbot.rocks/docs) for full details on how to configure auto moderation for your community. Using Webhooks Embeds What is a Webhook? A webhook is sort of a areverse APIa: rather than an application you own (like a bot) calling another application to receive data when it wants it, a webhook is something you can give to someone else's application to send data to you directly as soon as thereas something to share. This makes process very convenient efficient for both providers users. Now letas apply this definition to a more tangible example. Letas say you arenat around to reply to new e-mails for a while. Through power of webhooks you could have a setup that replies automatically! When an event happens on a service (like receiving an email), that service activates your webhook sends you data relevant to event that happened. That way, you have exactly information you need to automatically reply to each new e-mail you receive. So what does this mean for your server? Basically, Discord provides you with ability to have a webhook that sends a message to your server when itas activated, with option to send message to any channel along with having a cool name avatar of your choice.For example, letas say youare waiting for latest chapter of your favorite webcomic series to release. You can set up a webhook thatas connected with an RSS feed. feed will activate webhook when chapter is released a message will be posted on your server to notify you about it. This can be applied to many different things - potential is limitless! If service is capable of sending JSON Webhooks, Discord can often use these to create visually appealing embeds when it sends a message out. However, it can also accept raw text messages to pass along as well. Usage of Webhooks Webhooks are a great tool for services that have events that youare interested in latching onto. This can be incredibly useful for Content Creator communities where their latest YouTube videos Twitter posts can be funneled into channels for followers to have easy viewing access in your Discord community. You could also use this for a community thatas oriented towards an open-source technology by having events from GitHub be submitted directly to your server for people to keep track of. There are a lot of platforms out there that provide you with ability to handle everything by yourself- from creating Webhook through your Discord Server Settings to plugging it into platform you want updates from. However, this often requires you to be more familiar with at least some level of programming as many of these platforms require developer accounts. There can be a few hoops to jump through to get everything set up just right. This can often turn people off from using these types of webhooks. However, times are changing barrier to entry when dabbling into world of webhooks is much lower. These days, multiple third-party services exist that have handled all hard techy stuff for you. They can interface with platforms that would normally require you to do extra work to get data you want. IFTTT Zapier are two such services that lets you plug-and-play several useful platforms directly into your Discord server through a clean web interface that allows you to customize type of data your webhook receives, thus what messages are sent to your server. Just keep in mind that some services have restrictions on how many events can be sent to one webhook, so you may have to create multiple distinct webhooks for multiple functionalities. Note that these options restrictions are entirely platform-dependent. Discord has no problems handling whatever data is thrown at its webhooks when activated, even if itas from different sources. Thereas another use-case for Webhooks that is more unique. While theyare very useful for automated messages, theyare also great for one-off embed messages that have a very polished look! You have ability to customize name avatar of webhook, but if youare technologically-inclined you can create your own JSON data to activate webhook with. This allows you to fully define aesthetics of an embed in your message, giving a clean look to whatever information youare sending. One possible application is nice formatting for your server rules information, rather than just sending multiple plain text messages.Of course, there are other possible uses, only limit is your creativity! If youare not too keen on developing JSON data by hand, have no idea what a aJSONa is, services like Discohook also make it easy for anyone to take advantage of this use case. As a note, websites linked here are not endorsed by Discord are only a suggestion from authors of article. How do I set up a webhook? process of setting up webhooks can be roughly explained in five simple steps! Step 1: In your Discord server, you will need to create a webhook copy webhook URL. This URL is path for your webhook to receive an HTTP POST request from a service when an event occurs. Step 2: From this menu, you have ability to style your webhook with a name avatar. We recommend at least a name to distinguish its purpose. Step 3: If youare using a third-party service to handle events send messages, plug your webhook URL into service configure type of events that service should trigger for. Step 4: If your third-party service allows you to, configure additional options that will change look content of your message to way you like. Step 5: Now that youave created connection, when event happens, data will be sent directly to Discord your webhook will post a message in your preferred channel! What is an Embed? Weave been talking about embeds a lot, but we havenat quite explained what they are yet! In simple terms, embedding refers to integration of links, images, GIFs, videos other forms of content into messages on social media. An embed itself is a part of message that visually represents content in order to increase engagement. As a user of Discord, you have probably seen embeds more than a few times. They often are created automatically by Discord when a user sends a link, such as allowing you to view a YouTube video within Discord when a YouTube URL is shared. But did you know that Discord Bots Webhooks can create their own embeds with all kinds of data? Theyare pretty flexible! They can have colored borders, images, text fields, other kinds of fancy properties. If you're a developer, options available to you to create a good-looking embed are powerful versatile. For non-developers, platforms may give you visualizations that help you plug-and-play data into a website for customization purposes. There are also online tools to help you do this too! Here are several of those properties that can be modified in an embed in order to style it, to give you an idea of whatas possible when you have ability to style your messages: Markdown is also supported in an embed. Here is an image to showcase an example of these properties: Example image to showcase elements of an embedAn important thing to note is that embeds also have their limitations, which are set by API. Here are some of most important ones you need to know:An important thing to note is that embeds also have their limitations, which are set by API. Here are some of most important ones you need to know: If you feel like experimenting even further you should take a look at full list of limitations provided by Discord here.Itas very important to keep in mind that when you are writing an embed, it should be in JSON format. Some bots even provide an embed visualizer within their dashboards. You can also use this embed visualizer tool which provides visualization for bot webhook embeds. a Benefits of using Webhooks There are several benefits to using webhooks in your community including simplicity, versatility, automation, customization, accessibility. Simplicity. Webhooks are straightforward lacking in complexity. They have a single function, which is to send a designated message when they are activated. Versatility. Webhooks have many different use cases, all stemming from being able to send a message upon activation. This allows for many types of automation powered by other services, allows you to send clean looking messages manually. Both of these setups have their own various uses ranging from posting updates logging to posting custom messages for an aesthetic purpose. Automation. With webhooks, there isnat a need to constantly look for updates post them yourself. Once set up, a webhook will automatically post any updates you need. Customization. Each webhook can have a unique name avatar, each message it sends can be unique as well. You can have multiple webhooks with different looks in different channels use each of them however you like. Accessibility. Once you create a webhook, all you need is its URL a website that will push messages. Since these webhooks are hosted on Discord, they donat need to be hosted like a normal bot, often saving moderation teams from encountering a financial investment to use them, making them more easily available to all users. Webhooks vs. Bots Webhooks bots, while having slight similarities, are actually very different from each other. There are several aspects we have to look at when comparing two: a Even though this comparison is important for better understanding of both bots webhooks, it does not mean you should limit yourself to only picking one other. Sometimes, bots webhooks work their best when working together. Itas not uncommon for bots to use webhooks for logging purposes to distinguish notable messages with a custom avatar name for that message. Both tools are essential for a server to function properly make for a powerful combination. a Even though this comparison is important for better understanding of both bots webhooks, it does not mean you should limit yourself to only picking one other.

Despite their limitations lack of functions compared to bots, theyare still very useful A play an important role in automation decoration of your server. Overall, webhooks are a great tool for pushing various messages, with limitless customization opportunities. Ultimately, choice of using them depends solely on your needs preferences. Internal Conflict Resolution Causes of Internal Conflicts There can be many causes for conflicts between your moderators, some of which occur more often than others. Some of these can easily be prevented, while others might need a more intentful thought process to stop them from escalating to a conflict. Personality Clashes Differences main reason for conflicts to arise is a difference in personalities amongst your team. Everyone perceives, analyzes responds differently to certain situations. While this should be a learning opportunity for everyone involved, it can lead to arguments when moderators can not get along. While emphasizing there are different approaches to same issue, you should teach moderators to learn from each other instead of disagreements ending in a conflict. When a moderator constantly disagrees with someone else, ends up in a personal argument, try taking them aside let them know that they should be working on their personal issues. You can help them as an objective observer - it can be very valuable to let members of your team know that you understand their individual perspectives are working to balance them. Try to avoid aHalo/Horns effecta as much as possible. This is a type of cognitive bias where your view of someoneas actions can influence how you think feel about that person in general, both positively as well as negatively. Poor Communication Misunderstandings between your moderators can lead to a conflict as well, especially when there is a different understanding of how a situation should be handled. Having transparent, consistent communication where everyone is on same page is very important in an online setting such as Discord. Text is often perceived differently than talking over voice even in person. Oftentimes a language barrier can lead to misinterpreting a message as well. Try to prevent misunderstandings from happening with clear communication when misunderstandings happen, step in where possible explain how situation should be handled. Foster a culture where it is not only allowed but encouraged to ask for clarification on someoneas statement if you have any doubts about what their intent was. Bullying Harassment Making jokes is beneficial for maintaining a healthy welcoming environment even a way to deal with tough situations moderators may face. However, it is important to make sure that jokes donat push boundaries of what is appropriate lead to perceived bullying of server members behind closed doors, even other members of your own team.What is perceived to be a harmless in-joke in context could out of context seem like a malicious unwarranted comment. When it is clear someone is not comfortable with certain jokes feels targeted, you need to step in clear situation by telling moderators involved that you want a positive atmosphere where everyone feels welcomed comfortable while clearly identifying what line was crossed so it does not happen again. Thatas not to say that all close knit groups trend towards exclusionary jokes, but it is something that can happen without a team even being cognizant that itas a problem. Hence why itas pertinent to keep inclusivity good faith intent in mind with situations like this. Unfair Treatment A main cause for conflicts is unfair treatment amongst members of your team. This might be because there is a lack of equal opportunities, because there are unrealistic expectations. Make sure that everyone on your team is treated equally as everyone deserves same treatment, regardless of your personal relationships. This also means you other moderators should have reasonable expectations of each other. Moderators often volunteer to help out in your community, so donat expect them to be available at all times; they might have other responsibilities as well. Any mod teamas north star should be that areal life comes firsta, to be lenient amongst themselves in face of that. Unclear Responsibilities Sometimes it is not clear what responsibilities everyone has on team. This can lead to misunderstandings eventually to conflicts. Make sure everyone on team receives adequate training information on what different roles positions should be doing. You might want to divide different responsibilities amongst members of your team between different roles, such as moderators administrators. Be as transparent clear as possible on what everyone should be doing. Competition Sometimes moderators feel that they are competing against each other, especially if there are statistics promotions available. You should always be clear that moderation is not about competition, it is about helping your community in best way possible. Not every moderator has same time available to help, so naturally there are going to be differences amongst your team. Moderation is not about quantity but quality - if this negatively skewed competitive atmosphere is a frequent issue, it may be worth looking at whether there are mechanisms within your community that encourage competition conflicts that could be removed revised, such as quotas, public moderation statistics, leaderboards. Different Values Standards Moderators usually come from all over world might have different values. Sometimes, these might result in a conflict. Remind your moderators that they should always respect each other's values, regardless of their own opinion. Moderators should be able to explain why they feel a certain way in order for others to be more understanding of situation. When someone has values that do not align with serveras moderation philosophy, you might need to remove them from your team. Unresolved Underlying Issues It is not always possible to immediately see a reason for a conflict, this might be due to unresolved underlying issues. It is very hard to know these without having a conversation with everyone involved. There can be many more causes for a dispute to arise, but it is always important to find underlying issue which causes a conflict, only then are you able to resolve it. Preventing Internal Conflicts To minimize prevent conflicts from happening, try as best as you can to get a comprehensive view of why how conflicts occur in your server. It is very important to develop interpersonal relationships with all of your moderators value their contributions to server. Encourage moderators to take initiative in projects they are enthusiastic about, especially in collaboration with other moderators. Just as moderators set a positive example in your community, you as leader of your moderation team should set a positive example within your team. When you propose major changes to server, listen to your teamas viewpoints before deploying explain why a decision was made. Good communication is very important within a team, not only to prevent conflicts, but also to keep all moderators on same page. All moderators should feel involved informed when you are making major changes. You can give your moderators regular feedback on how they are doing what they can improve. Make sure moderators always feel welcome to provide feedback constructively positively to each other that they can always contact you someone in charge in case a conflict does arise. Try to discourage gossip within your team, both internal external. When moderators start to talk about each other behind their backs, it becomes personal can distort relationship your moderators have how they see themselves within server. Instead, encourage moderators to form friendships with each other by organizing social events for your staff. During those events, you can learn about different personalities in your team. Last, but not least; you shouldnat lash out over mistakes.Give feedback where it is appropriate move on. Be quick to forgive forget. You should always prevent belittling your moderators while also creating a culture of de-escalating situations in private. Resolving an Internal Conflict There are many ways to resolve conflict internally most of these will depend on what cause is for conflict. A good way of resolving conflicts is using Thomas-Kilmann model. It should be stated that conflicts are not necessarily bad shouldnat be avoided at all costs. When you are working in a team, it is important to be able to challenge status quo question each other, to keep everyone on aligned up to date. In Thomas-Kilmann model, there are two dimensions when you are choosing a course of action: assertiveness cooperativeness. Assertiveness is degree to which you try to satisfy your own needs where cooperativeness is degree to which you try satisfy other person's concerns. Based on these dimensions, there are five ways to handle a conflict: All these different ways to handle a conflict are your intention to solve them: Sometimes situations occur differently than you expect at first. Donat jump to conclusions when you are dealing with a conflict, as reasons for conflicts are often more complex than they first appear. A Everyone tends to resolve conflicts in a certain way, so try to balance them so you donat end up overwhelmed overwhelm others. first step is to identify cause for conflict. You might already know this based on previously sent messages, but sometimes you need to contact everyone involved separately in private to determine cause of conflict. It is your responsibility to determine how to handle a situation. While collaborating together to resolve a conflict might look most appealing, this will not always be possible. Try not to completely avoid a conflict: if you feel uneasy dealing with conflicts donat want to give moderators feedback, you might not want to be in a leading position. If you need to resolve a conflict, choose a neutral place to work it out. This might be a separate server a private group. None of people involved in conflict should have power over others, so you someone else should act as an objective observer. If conflict is between other moderators, you should offer guidance, but donat offer solutions: ultimately it is up to others to resolve their conflicts, you are not taking sides. Remember that not all conflicts require consequences. Most conflicts are sparked by passion of your moderators who are simply in disagreement on how to deal with situations. Try to turn a conflict into a learning opportunity for everyone involved. Let them explain how they view situation how they would have handled it behaved differently. Afterwards, you should be able to identify specific disagreements that you can solve. Listen to everyone involved give everyone an equal opportunity to express themselves. Remind everyone to stay respectful at all times, even if they disagree with each other. Giving Receiving Feedback As said before, you should discourage gossip within your team encourage each other to give constructive feedback. It is important that everyone knows how to give receive feedback to prevent a conflict from happening in future situations. Giving Feedback When you notice a moderator that displays behavior takes action that can be improved, you should give them feedback on how to improve this in future. Donat rush in giving your feedback, everyone needs time to process. When a situation becomes heated, it will not be best time to give feedback. Remember to always give feedback in private! If you are in doubt as to whether not you should give feedback, see if you can recognize a pattern in their behavior actions. Everyone makes mistakes that is perfectly fine as mistakes serve as a learning opportunity you should only give them feedback if it becomes a pattern. Additionally, itas recommended that you ask for consent to give feedback. While this may seem a little counterintuitive to helping moderator improve change, blindsiding someone when theyare not ready can result in backlash rather than progress. When you do decide to give someone feedback, donat focus on person who made a mistake: focus on their behavior action instead.By making feedback personal equating it to an issue with individual rather than their choices, you can come off as argumentative unconstructive biased. Never exaggerate their behavior, be sure that you are clear specific . When you make generalized vague comments about someone, they will not be able to improve their behavior. Feedback should be actionable- there should be a suggestion a change that individual can work on as a result of feedback. Otherwise itas just airing your grievances, which is unproductive for all parties involved. next time you see someone doing something good when you have given them feedback in past, give them a compliment! Positive, specific feedback is especially effective in encouraging repeating said good actions. Giving each other positive feedback is just as important as giving each other constructive corrective feedback. Remember to always treat others as you would like to be treated yourself. It is proven that negative feedback is given mostly when people are experiencing negative emotions like hunger, anger, loneliness, tiredness. This negative feedback method is referred to as HALT-mode, it is important to try to avoid situations where you are giving feedback when you find yourself in one of these states. Receiving Feedback When someone is giving you feedback, it is very important to listen to what they have to say. Donat jump to conclusions, react defensively, disagree immediately. Take a moment to summarize feedback as you understand it to make sure you have understood their feedback correctly. You should always thank someone for giving them feedback, even if you disagree. It has to be clear you are welcoming feedback to improve. If you do not thank them, they might not give you valuable feedback in future. Ideally feedback is very clear specific, in which case you can end conversation by thanking them for their feedback reflect back what you are going to do with feedback in future. Other times it might not be understandable to you as a result, it is unclear what you should do differently in future. In this case you should ask questions to understand their feedback better. To have a better understanding of what they want to achieve with their feedback, it is a good idea to ask other person how they would have handled situation how they would have behaved. After this you should thank them reflect back on what you are going to do with their feedback. It is okay to let someone know why you disagree with their feedback, but remember to stay respectful at all times explain clearly why you disagree. Everyone should feel heard, even if you are not acting on their feedback. Handling Demotions There are many reasons why you might want to remove a moderator from your team, including internal conflicts you are unable to resolve. Removing demoting a moderator is not easy to do, but can be a necessary evil. Removing someone from your team should be in best interest of your community team can often be in best interest of that person as well. Be sure to give someone an opportunity to learn from their mistakes before removing them. Give a warning first have a conversation in private with them, following principles of giving receiving feedback outlined above. While it is not easy to deliver bad news, here are some tips to keep in mind when you do want to remove someone from your team. Donat delay conversation Once you have made decision to remove someone from your team, donat hesitate wait for conversation to take place. When someone is causing more issues than they are solving, they will need to be removed sooner than later, but make sure that someone has had enough opportunities to fix their mistakes resolve their issues. Please make sure you have this conversation in private, for example in direct messages a voice call. Keep it short clear When you are talking to someone you are removing, it is important to keep your message short clear. Tell them they are being removed from team, why you have made this decision, when this will take effect. Be transparent in what reasons you have for removing them, but do not go into too much detail with specific examples. This may result in a conversation where you are arguing about these examples rather than informing them of their removal. A Youare aiming for polite dismissal, not a lambasting of their character. Stick to your decision Despite your message being short, clear, transparent, you might still receive counter arguments as to why they should not be removed to give them another chance. It is important they can express themselves, but it should be clear at all times that decision to remove them has already been made is not up for debate. Always listen carefully to what someone has to say appreciate their feedback, but unless someone has substantial evidence a mistake was made, repeat your decision make it clear that your decision is final. Be helpful compassionate Even though you are delivering bad news, you should take a supportive approach in conversation. Remember that while it might be difficult for you to deliver bad news, it most definitely is difficult to be on receiving end. Show empathy for them especially when they have done a good job in past. In some cases, moderator youare removing may wish to receive feedback on what they can improve - giving this feedback in a constructive fashion is important, will help them to avoid future problems. This feedback should include reflecting on positive contributions they made to team, helping them understand what causes of conflict might have been while they were on your team, simply trying to give them something positive to take forward work on as a result of your conversation. This conversation shouldnat reflect a reversal of your decision, but can be a useful point of reference if they want to join other servers work on improving their skills down line, perhaps even re-apply to join team in future. Inform your team When someone has been removed from your team, make sure to inform team of this decision. It is up to you whether not you want to share reason for their removal, but refrain from sharing details as these are confidential, especially when these could be potentially harmful to someone. You also want to prevent anyone, including yourself, from talking bad about them, as this sets a wrong precedent for your team. As with your decision, you should be straightforward clear to your team, an example of this could be: aToday we have decided to remove Sarah from our team. I will not go into too much detail why this decision was made, but we believe it is best decision for community entire team.a In case someone was removed because of misbehavior, you might want to include that in message, as this gives team assurance you are not removing someone because of a personal conflict, it shows a strong message about how you want moderators to conduct themselves. Wrapping Up In every group, eventually a conflict dispute will arise which needs to be resolved. There are common causes, such as personality clashes differences, poor communication, unclear responsibilities, harassment. To minimize prevent conflicts from happening, try understand as much as possible why conflicts occur in your server. It is very important to develop interpersonal relationships with all of your moderators value their contributions to server. Try to discourage gossip within your team. When moderators start to talk about each other behind their backs, it becomes personal can distort relationship your moderators have how they see themselves within server. You can resolve conflicts using Thomas-Kilmann model. It is important to know conflicts are not necessarily bad shouldnat be avoided at all costs. When you are working in a team, it is important to be able to challenge status quo question each other, to keep everyone on same page sharp. When you want to give feedback to someone, talk to them in private be clear specific. Prevent giving feedback when you feel hungry, angry, lonely, tired. Focus on their behavior action instead never exaggerate their behavior. Oppositely, when someone is giving you feedback, it is very important to listen to what they have to say to avoid jumping to conclusions, reacting defensively, disagreeing immediately. Take a moment to summarize feedback to make sure you have understood their feedback correctly. Sometimes you need to remove someone from your staff team. Donat delay this conversation, keep it short clear, stick to your decision. When conversation is taking place, be helpful compassionate do not forget to inform your team as well, but make it clear that certain things remain private for safety privacy of those involved. Keeping all of those points in mind when managing a team environment will be integral to maintaining a healthy atmosphere full of various viewpoints that are united in shared desire to keep your community safe. Using Modmail Bots What are Modmail Bots? Before we discuss how to use a modmail bot, we should explore what they are what purpose they serve. Simply put, modmail bots are bots that allow users to contact moderators of a server via a direct message with bot. bot then relays these messages to entire moderation team by creating a private channel on server visible only to server moderators (also referred to as a aticketa). Moderators can then use this private channel to have bot relay their own messages back to original user, all while keeping a record of entire conversation within server. Moderators can even discuss ticket together in that channel without user seeing since it requires usage of a specific command to send a message to user. There are numerous modmail bots online, each with their own styles features. Some modmail bots can be self-hosted, while others are hosted publicly online! Here are some examples of modmail bots you can use: a It is important to do research into readily available bots to understand what your server needs to choose whichever one best meets those needs. Please note, content of this article is not endorsed by any developer company related to bots. What Can Modmail Contribute to my Server? Before adding a modmail bot into your server, you should determine if you need one by considering benefits drawbacks of modmail bots. Letas review pros cons of modmail bots to help with this decision. One of biggest benefits of having a modmail bot is better organization. Anytime a user opens a ticket, be it a question concern about server, instead of trying to figure out which moderator is online available, a user can quickly DM modmail bot get in contact with entire moderation team while also notifying active moderators online. This also eliminates over usage of pinging entire moderation team in public channels. a next benefit of modmail bots is team discussions. In above example, weare using ModMail bot by CHamburr. As you can see, a user has opened up a ticket that can be viewed by entire moderation team. team can then decide who wants to respond to ticket, as well as discuss ticket in question among themselves more efficiently handle issue. Team discussions are great for trickier questions that not everyone on team might know answer to. In image below, you can see an example of what moderators see from their side. team can split their focus knock out tickets depending on their priority, urgency, even work together to pick up a ticket if another mod has signed off. ability to read through moderator discussions work together is a great team building exercise for moderator teams! a a next benefit of modmail bots are information logs. Most modmail bots have a modmail log that shows all of modmail tickets that have been opened closed along with useful receipts of conversations that happened in channels. This is great for administrators/lead moderators who want to see how cases were handled want to catch up on what theyave missed while offline. This also helps moderators look back on reporting history if an old report is continued at a different period of time if they suspect someone is abusing modmail. Another benefit of having a modmail bot is anonymity. Some modmail bots allow you to reply to user anonymously which can decrease chances of someone harassing a moderator, other unpleasant situations that may come from having to action someone. Users can sometimes get upset want to seek revenge after being banned, muted, kicked from a server, so being able to communicate with someone action them without revealing your identity is extremely valuable. Moderators no longer need to act as amiddlemana between a user rest of team. moderator can speak on behalf of team use language such as awea instead of aIa which can communicate to user that it isnat just one person handling their case, but rather entire team while keeping their identity safe. a a Something that you will notice when moderating is that there are usually some questions concerns that come up frequently. Having a modmail bot can help you better understand what your community needs are better visualize what most frequent moderator tickets are about. With this knowledge, you can create custom quick-replies that you your team can use to more efficiently resolve tickets! Having same response to a scam DM that is used by all moderators on your server makes responding to those types of tickets quick, easy, consistent. Moderators can copy paste replies, use custom commands to reply with pre-made messages. Once you have set up quick replies, you can answer many tickets without needing to think of how to reply, making your replies consistent no matter who is responding to a ticket. Here are a few examples of situations you can make tailored custom-replies for ease, speed, consistency: It is important to know limitations drawbacks of modmail bots before deciding if your community needs one. Letas explore some of ways these bots can be abused, as well as other negatives you should know about. Please keep in mind that every modmail bot is different, so you can work to choose, even code, a modmail bot that may eliminate some of these drawbacks if you are concerned about them. Modmail bots are vulnerable to spam since anyone on server can DM bot to open up a ticket. Be it a targeted spam attack multiple users reporting same thing. Some modmail bots allow you to block a member from opening up future tickets. Depending on what kind of modmail bot you use, one drawback is that some modmail bots might not save conversations between you user who made ticket, only showing reason ticket was closed. Some modmail bots will save conversation, but not any comments made by other moderators regarding inquiry inside ticket channel which can erase a lot of discussion context from replies that are made. If you want to be able to track actions, you have to prioritize a bot that does save information logs. Another drawback is learning curve from using a new bot. Members that are new to Discord that arenat familiar with modmail bots can have trouble interacting using bot to report issues. Almost all modmail bots require a user to DM bot, which can go against initial instincts be challenging to new users. Some users have their DMs turned off which makes using a modmail bot more complicated if user canat receive DM replies from bot. One solution to this is to ping user in a public channel asking for them to change their DM settings so bot can communicate with them.Members figuring out a modmail bot for first time can lead to atesta messages which will spam your modmail tickets. While these arenat a big concern are mostly harmless, depending on size of your server, multiple users atestinga how bot works can lead to a lot of time cleaning up tickets. Similarly to how a modmail bot can be a learning curve for your members, a modmail bot can also be a learning curve for your moderation team. Learning how a modmail bot works can take some time to get used to if your team has never used one before. Depending on how familiar your team is with using bots, onboarding time may vary, so be sure to set aside time for learning teaching how to use a modmail bot. We have an article on Training Onboarding New Moderators that should help with this! Uses for Modmail Bots Modmail bots can be used in a variety of ways. They not only serve as a way to communicate with moderators, but also help with organization structure can be used for other purposes. Letas look at different uses of a modmail bot, how it can make life on server easier. aQuestions. Modmail bots help users who might have questions that they donat feel comfortable asking in public. This can be questions related to server, more private sensitive matters. By using a modmail bot, moderation team can efficiently answer question depending on who knows answer, user gets a sense of privacy by not having to ask in public. As mentioned previously, having a set of quick-replies to frequently asked questions makes responding to questions a breeze. Some modmail bots even have custom command replies where you can create commands to reply with a specific text, depending on command. For example, replying with command a=helloa can reply to ticket with a premade message meant to greet user open a conversation, such as: aHello. Thank you for contacting moderation team. How can we help you today?a aBug Reports. You can implement a modmail bot in a support server that deals with bug reports. Some larger communities have two serversaone for main community, one for support, depending on community product. Organizing bug reports using a modmail bot is an easy way to keep track of issues in one place. With ability to give a closing reason, you can later search modmail logs to look back at what sort of bugs were reported by different users. aBan Appeals. Anonymity is important when dealing with troublemakers online. One way to use a modmail bot is to have a ban appeal server for users who would like to re-enter your community after being banned. With this setup appeals go through modmail system so that banned users canat talk in any channels can only interact with staff team through bot. Moderators can then review appeal together reply to banned user anonymously through bot. Community Reports. Sometimes a member of your community needs to report something to moderators that isnat rule breaking has information regarding another user that is important for team to know. A modmail bot is great for relaying these types of reports to team so everyone is notified at same time without having to utilize an emergency ping. Server Feedback. Members of your server can provide feedback using a modmail bot. Using modmail for feedback removes need for a feedback channel guarantees that team will see feedback when it is sent. Staff Applications. There are different ways you can have staff applications for a server. Depending on who needs to see evaluate application, it can make sense to use a modmail bot to receive server staff applications in smaller arenas. When an application is made, a modmail ticket will open conveniently for moderators admins to look at. You can even comment within ticket to evaluate each application, case by case! Keep in mind that there are a limited number of channels (in this case, tickets) that can be made in a channel category so this will only work for smaller servers.The above list are just some of many common ways that modmail bots can be used to strengthen communication with your server. use cases for a modmail bot is limited only by your imagination type of bot youare using! Modmail Best Practices When using a modmail bot, it is important that your moderation team is on same page. Make sure there are clear protocols of how to handle tickets. An easy way to ensure that end-user doesnat get messages sent by multiple moderators is to have a moderator say that they will handle ticket inside ticket channel itself. This way, moderators arenat stepping on each otheras toes ticket can be handled efficiently. In image below, weare using a modmail bot that sends all messages sent in ticket to user, unless it has a specific command. Other modmail bots might only send a message to user if a reply command is used, so be sure to read bot documentation to know how your modmail bot handles communication between moderators user sending a ticket. a a Another good practice is to close any old resolved tickets as quickly as possible. If user has no further questions, it can be helpful to send a final message stating that if there are no further questions, ticket will be closed soon. This way, you reduce amount of open tickets maintain a clean organized modmail.As mentioned before, anonymity in responding to tickets can help reduce amount of harassment you your moderators may receive from rule-breakers. When using a modmail bot you can use discretion when deciding whether to respond anonymously with a more personalized response, depending on situation. Here are a few scenarios where itas okay to respond regularly: In most cases, however, it is better to respond anonymously especially when dealing with any modmail tickets related to actioning punishing another user. This applies to handling ban appeals if you have such a system set up. It isnat a big deal if you reply to a question without showing your name. same is not true if you show your name to someone who has been punished on your server.Each server has its own tone style when it comes to moderation. Some servers are more formal may have an official tone, while others might have a more relaxed easygoing tone. It is important to keep this in mind when responding to modmail tickets so that your tone in modmail responses is consistent with tone set by server. This article has explored ways modmail bots can strengthen how your team communicates with your community as well as direct advantages disadvantages that exist when introducing such a bot to your server. In some ways moderation becomes significantly easier, but in other ways, negatives like spam from these bots can be overwhelming introduce new problems to solve. Moderating a server can involve a lot of different moving parts it is important to analyze your communityas needs as it grows, taking into consideration whether a modmail bot is included in that growth. Use what youave learned in this article to make a decision thatas right for you your community.If you decide that a modmail bot isnat a good fit for your community, but you still want some bot help on your server, check out our Auto Moderation on Discord article! Managing Moderation Teams Getting to Know Your Team Above all else, foundation of a good moderation team is familiarity. By knowing your fellow moderators better, what they do, where they live, youall relate to them better. Youall get to know peopleas strengths weaknesses, learn to understand them better, get a feeling for when they need help, vice versa. Though you all may be in different time zones have diverse backgrounds youare all working towards same goal which is keeping community you all care for safe. Who knows- you might find that you share a lot of same interests along way, make great new friends, deepen existing friendships during your time together as moderators. Here are a few basic things you should do to familiarize with each other: Allocating Resources A moderation team needs a clear structure a unified understanding of server moderation, which has already been covered in Developing moderator guidelines. Now weare going to expand on how to utilize each every single moderator's abilities further. A moderation team can range from a few members in a small server to a huge team with 30 more staff depending on server size. bigger your community gets more team needs to be organized. While they are all moderators, it doesnat mean they all do same job. Some of your moderators, especially experienced moderators, are likely to be in more administrative positions. They usually stay further away from general day-to-day channel moderation while newer moderators are focused on watching conversations enforcing server rules. If you do have one of these larger mod teams, consider delegating certain moderators to tasks responsibilities that theyad be best suited for, rather than having a jack of all trades, master of none situation. This allows to divide team into smaller sub-teams that talk to each other more frequently in designated channels regarding their specific mod duties. Here are a few examples of sub-teams that are common within larger communities: Moderators that primarily contribute to community by enforcing rules, watching conversations, engaging members, solving member to member conflicts showing moderation presence. same type of moderators could also exist for Voice Channels, but that is mostly for very large communities. Moderators that are extremely familiar with permissions, bots, programming, etc. Ideally, they arenat just able to operate bots youare using, but also maintain them. A custom bot tailored to your community is always something to consider. Having a bot hosted ain-housea by a moderator within your team adds an additional layer of security. Bot Team is very valuable in making new creative ideas possible especially in automating day-to-day processes. Most servers host events, from community run events to events run by staff members. Event Supervisors watch over community members hosting events, watching out for new events, while being general point of communication in hosting announcing them. These are ways of how moderators can be utilized better by giving them a designated job depending on your team's size, also giving them ability to dive into certain topics of moderation more in-depth within your community, which overall makes managing coordinating a team as a whole easier. Decision Making As server size number of moderators increases, harder it becomes to hear every voice opinion. As a team, decisions need to be made together, they need to be consistent, equitable, take into account as many different opinions as possible. Itas important to establish a system, especially when making big decisions. Often, there are decisions that need to be done right at very moment. For example, when someone posts offensive content. In most cases, a moderator will act on their perception of rules punish offenders accordingly. At that very moment, offending content has to be removed, leaving little to no time to gather a few staff members make a decision together. This is where consistency comes into play. more your moderators share equal knowledge same mindset, more consistent moderation actions get. This is why itas important to have moderator guidelines a clear structure. Itas very important to give every moderator freedom so they donat have to ask every time before they can take action, but itas also important to hear out as many opinions on any major server changes as possible, if time allows it. Growth Over time, a moderation team grows. They grow in many ways, in their abilities, in number of moderators, but also grow together as a team. Every new moderation team will face challenges they need to overcome together every already established team will face new situations that they have to adapt to deal with. Itas important to give a moderator something to work towards. Mods should look forward to opportunities that will strengthen their capabilities as a moderator strengthen teamas performance as a whole. You should let moderators know that they have potential for growth in their future as a moderator. It can be something like specializing into specific topics of moderation, like introducing them into managing setting up bots. Perhaps over time they will progress to a senior moderator focus more on administrative side of things. Discord Mod Academy can be a valuable resource in encouraging moderator growth as well. While they may be familiar with some of concepts in Discord Moderation Academy, no moderator can know everything these articles have potential to further refine their moderation knowledge enhance their abilities. Professionalism Moderators are direct representatives of your community as such should be a reflection of what an ideal community member looks like. Many things tie into showing this professionalism, ranging from how moderators chat with members in public to consistency in moderator actions. presence of a moderator should never make people uncomfortable - there needs to be a fine line between aI can chat with this moderator like with any other membera aThis is a moderator I need to take what they're saying seriouslya. Here are a few attributes in what makes a moderation team look be professional: Your team should share positivity, engage conversation, show respect for others maintain a professional look. Make it clear to your moderation team that they are a highly visible perhaps incredibly scrutinized group within your community- to conduct themselves appropriately with those aspects in mind. Problem Solving As with all group efforts, there is a possibility for friction to occur within a moderation team. This is undoubtedly something that youare all going to have to address at some point in your mod teamas lifespan. Itas very important to deal with these situations as soon as they come up. Many people don't feel comfortable dealing with conflict directly as it can be uncomfortable. However, getting to any potential problems before they become serious can prevent more severe issues from cropping up in future. goal of a problem-solving process is to make a moderation team more conflict-friendly. As a general problem solving process, you should: With that in mind, there are also situations where youad want to exercise more discretion. Something that might prompt this is when a moderator makes a mistake. It can be both uncomfortable embarrassing to be acalled outa for something, so often enough best option is to speak to someone privately if you think theyave made a mistake. After moderator understands situation acknowledges mistake, problem can be talked about with rest of team, mainly to prevent situations like these in future. Still, sometimes there are situations where problems canat be solved things get more more heated, in end separating is unavoidable. Moderators leave on their own have to be removed. Your team members should always be given option to take a break from moderation- especially to avoid burnout. You can learn more about how to deal with moderator burnout here. Reviewing Taking a moment to look back at history progression of your community your mod team can be a useful way to evaluate where your team is at where it needs to be. time frame can be of your choosing, but some common intervals can be monthly, quarterly, half year. You donat always get to talk with your moderators every day - most of us volunteer, moderating as a hobby, having our own lives while living scattered all over world. With all of that going on it can be hard to find time space to discuss things that you might feel are lacking could be changed regarding server, thatas why reviewing is important. A Community Review can be done in many ways. For most, a channel asking a few basic questions, like how community has developed since last review, how activity growth has changed, is a good way to start. Most importantly, you want to hear how moderation team is doing. Talk about mistakes that have happened recently, how they can be prevented, review some of moderator actions that have been taken. A review allows everyone to share their thoughts, see what everyone is up to, deal with more long term issues. It also allows giving your moderators feedback on their performance. Summary essence of managing a moderation team is to be open-minded, communicate to listen to each other. Endeavor to manage decisions confront problems in an understanding, calm, professional way. Give moderators opportunity to grow, designated tasks, but also time to review, break rest. Remember, youare in this together! Protecting Against Scams on Discord Internet Safety Checklist Internet Safety doesnat have to be exhausting. Below are some simple but effective ways to make sure youare on guard against any potential neaer-do-wells in your DMs, even outside of Discord. Only Open Trusted Links from Those You Know This may feel like a given, but a surprising amount of security issues stem from people clicking on links before checking if theyare real deal. Always double-check a link youare clicking a link shortening services can easily mask unsafe websites programs. We recommend getting it checked against a resource like VirusTotal to see if someone has already flagged it as potentially dangerous. In addition, Discord has its own systems in place to remove malicious links weare constantly evolving those systems. Donat Download Programs Run Code You Donat Recognize Itas not advised to download run software that doesnat come from a reputable source. Downloading running programs that someone sends you unprompted is almost always a bad idea.If a person claiming to have aspecial access to featuresa new software says they need you to run on your own computer, theyare misleading you in order to get your personal info with their shady programs. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Never Give Your Password to Anyone Thereas no reason to give it up, ever. Sharing your password not only gives away access to your account but also exposes any personal information you have tied to that account a potentially any website where you use that password a making you vulnerable to more than just a single account takeover. Discord Safety Checklist above tips can be applied anywhere on internet! Next, we'll share some Discord-specific tips to ensure you can be vigilant against baddies targeting your account community: Decide Who Can Canat Send You DMs Disabling DMs for a particular server is one of best ways to prevent bad apples hiding inside larger communities from contacting you. To adjust who can canat DM you, head into User Settings > Privacy & Safety, then scroll down to aServer Privacy Defaults.a From there, youall find option to aAllow direct messages from server members.a Feel free to adjust it as you wish, but do note that this new state only applies to servers joined after changing toggle; it wonat retroactively affect your existing servers. If you turn this option off, members of newly-joined servers canat contact you via DM unless youare friends with them beforehand. Receiving mail might be nice, but receiving suspicious messages from people you donat know is less nice. If you're in a server you trust donat mind being messaged by those in it, you can toggle privacy setting on an individual basis. Head to that server on desktop mobile select its name to open server's settings, choose aPrivacy Settings.a Once there, youall find aAllow direct messages from server members"" option. Turn that on, youare free to receive all sorts of DMs from everyone in that server, regardless of if youare friends not! If youave joined a lot of communities, consider auditing list see if youare comfortable with letting non-friends message you from that server, if opening up is inviting unnecessary risk into your inbox. Audit your Serveras Permissions Understanding which permissions your mods members have access to is key to keeping everyone within it safe. If you're a server owner, have you checked your permissions list lately? Who has what perms? Did you know they had that access for how long? If answer to any of these questions was a resounding :shrug_emoji:, itas time to do a review of your server setup to ensure that only those who really need powerful permissions have them. Specifically, make sure that only moderators you trust have access to permissions that can change powerful server tools, including any bots webhooks you might add to server. Be vigilant for bots that are impersonating larger well-known bots. In almost every case, any large reputable moderation bot will never need admin permissions to work properly. Only give a bot permissions required for tasks you need no more a look for a Verified checkmark on a well-known bot before adding it. If you need a refresher on how permissions on Discord work, you can check out Help Center article here. If you have a basic understanding of permissions system want a more comprehensive look at what they mean in a moderation sense, we also have this article from Discord Moderation Academy. Keep Invite Links Updated If you update your serveras links, make sure that your community potential newcomers are aware of changes update any social media pages where you shared them. If possible, delete references to old invite links make it known that those links have been updated. This is doubly-so for servers Partnered, Verified Level 3-boosted servers that utilize a vanity URL: if your server loses changes its custom invite link, nefarious communities may swoop in claim your old one. If this happens before you update your public-facing invites, people trying to join your community may instead join a server thatas looking to cause trouble. A In addition to updating existing links, consider implementing easy-to-follow community rules around invite sharing encouraging members to always verify where a server invite leads who it is coming from before clicking it. Pro Tip: Try pasting one of those invites to a Discord message to preview where it leads to before opening it! (But of course, donat make your invite testing look like a spam message by pasting a random invite in #general.) Why Would Someone Want Access to My Account? If someone gains control of your Discord account, they will have as much reign over your account as you do: Theyall have ability to change your username, password, email tied to account, any other information associated with your account. Theyall also be able to see any personal info associated with your account once theyare in it. While most consider apersonal infoa to be payment info email, it can also contain your private conversations messages in DMs servers alike. If you can see it, theyall be able to see it. As if they were new owner of any servers you own, theyall be able to make any changes they want: from server layout to server permissions, to bots webhooks to kicking everyone out of server, you name it. If your account is moderator of a server that a hacker is targeting, they might even use you as a stepping stone to cause further damage within community, even impersonate you to trick unsuspecting members. Some users may also target Discord accounts that have unique profile badges that are no longer available, such as Early Supporter Early Verified Bot Developer badges. If you have one of these unique badges, you should be extra-vigilant with your account. If your account is taken over hacker changes password, there isnat much you can immediately do to stop them. However, if you have 2-Factor Authentication enabled on your account, hacker will also be required to provide a 2FA code to change your password. We strongly recommend enabling 2FA, you can learn how in our 2FA blog post. Reporting what happened to Discord can help you regain ownership of your account, which can be done here a let us help you! Additional Reading: Common Scams Weave created an additional blog post describing types of scams floating around on Discord, which you can check out to familiarize yourself with signs that you may be dealing with a hacker who needs to be blocked: Common Scams What to Look Out For We recommend sharing it with larger communities that may benefit from this knowledge. With these recommendations in your pocket, youall be better able to foil any potential digital threats. Just like with keeping your IRL-self healthy whole, taking preventative measures can keep your virtual self safe secure. Stay safe out there! Scams What to Look out for Fake Games, Programs, Videos Downloads In this situation, a user pretending to be your friend, using a friendas compromised account, reaches out asking you to check out their video, test a game they made, practice running code they wrote. No matter backstory, theyall always ask you to download a program click a link they provide, resulting in a malicious program entering your computer and/or compromising your account. Another variation of this scheme involves a user asking you to atesta something for them, directing you to open developer tools on your internet browser while logged into web app. Theyall then ask you to show them your token a do not do this. With your token, malicious users can sign in take over your account. Discord will never ask you for your token, you should never have any reason to open Discordas Developer Console in first place. Note that this is only applicable to Discord on your internet browser, not desktop mobile application. a Fake Giveaways/NFT Drops This is similar to previous scheme in that usually it is, again, a trusted individual that DMs you. Sometimes it's in form of a well-known bot under facade that they are an administrator for a server that you're active in. It may involve very genuine-looking links to websites as well. Like we said, if it's too good to be true, it likely is. Discord Impersonation for Partner/Verified/HypeSquad Discord impersonation involves a hacker pretends to be messaging you from an aofficial Discord accounta offer entry to one of our community initiatives, such as HypeSquad Partner programs. This is nearly always fake. Below are two screenshots, both of which present themselves as official Discord-sent messages. However, of these two conversations, only right screenshot is actually from Discord. On right, you can note blurple aSystema tag next to senderas name, as well as Reply space being replaced with a unique banner that only official system messages come with. DM on left does its best to be convincing though. It even sends an invite link to a real Discord-run server called Discord Testers a somewhat-real-looking link to supposed Discord Hypesquad form. Scammers will use a technique of mixing real Discord invite links (to public Discord servers usually) with their malicious links in order to portray legitimacy lull you into a false sense of security. If you suss out that a DM is a fake, report it as Spam using red aReport Spama button at top of DM. This feature is one of many improvements that weare working on to help identify remove bad actors as soon as weare aware of them. a Free Nitro Scams One of oldest scams is temptation of afree Nitro.a While we canat discount people who may be truly full of generosity believe in gifting Nitro, getting a random DM from a stranger claiming to have chosen *you* for a Nitro giveaway is incredibly sus, most likely a scam. Discord will never ask you to scan a QR code in order to redeem a Nitro code. Do NOT scan any QR codes from people you donat know those you canat verify as legitimate. If you ever use QR Code Login to sign in to Discord, make sure youare using desktop app, if youare on web app, that your URL bar says ahttps://discord.com/logina exactly as it's written. above tactics are some of ways that scammers may attempt to socially-engineer you into giving up your information. Even if you donat click any of their links, it's best to simply block report them to us, rather than engage further. We encourage you to share this article with friends who may not be as informed as you a when everyoneas aware, our communities are safer than ever. Hereas a quick link back to Protecting Against Scams on Discord too. Stay safe out there! How Trust-Safety Addresses Violent Extremism on Discord Our History with Violent Extremism Weave been paying close attention to violent extremist groups movements ever since we learned how organizers of 2017 Unite Right Rally in Charlottesville, Virginia utilized Discord to plan their hateful activities. Back then, Discord Trust & Safety was a team of one, just beginning to make difficult decisions about how to properly moderate platform. Almost four years later, our Trust & Safety Team makes up 15% of Discordas near-400 employees splits its time between responding to user reports now proactively finding removing servers users engaging in high-harm activity like violent extremist organizing. Trust & Safety has spent a lot of time since 2017 trying to ensure that another event like Charlottesville isnat planned on our platform. Our team developed frameworks based on academic research on violent extremist radicalization behavior to better identify extremist users who try to use Discord to recruit organize. We keep up-to-date on research that can lend insight into how to evaluate understand extremist behavior online, our recent partnerships with organizations like Global Internet Forum for Countering Terrorism (GIFCT) Tech Against Terrorism (TAT) are intended to support this effort. How We Identify Violent Extremism Categorizing violent extremism itself is difficult because not all extremists have same motives believe in same ideas. Some individuals who adopt violent ideologies act on their beliefs by joining organized hate, terrorist, violent extremist groups. Others donat want to officially identify themselves as belonging to a particular movement, may instead form looser connections with others who have adopted same worldview. Different cultural contexts also influence belief systems behaviors, so violent extremist ideologies in one country will naturally be different from those on other side of world. Violent extremism is nuanced ideologies tactics behind them evolve fast. We donat try to apply our own labels identify a certain atypea of extremism. Instead, we evaluate user accounts, servers, content that is flagged to us based on common characteristics patterns of behavior, such as: Itas important to note that presence of one two of these signals doesnat automatically mean that we would classify a server as aviolent extremist.a While we might use these signs to help us determine a user spaceas intent purpose, we always want to understand context in which user content is posted before taking any action. How Did We Do on January 6? On day of Insurrection, our Trust & Safety agents were reviewing reports of hate speech, glorification of violence, misinformation about what was transpiring. We feel very fortunate that our team was able to locate remove many of most harmful servers dedicated to coordinating violence on January 6. Our ability to move proactively on servers advocating for violence was thanks to two main factors: first, we were able to surface reports from users on these spaces quickly; second, our Trust & Safety agents dedicated to countering violent extremism had been tracking these spaces ever since allegations of election fraud regarding 2020 U.S. presidential election had begun to spread. We believe itas important to talk about line we walk with Discord users who discuss politics to organize political activities like protests. Many people are frustrated with how society works how some governmental societal systems are structured. Naturally, people have strong opinions on how things should shouldnat change. Now more than ever, itas important for meaningful conversations, debates, exchanges of ideas to take place. Weare glad that users across world have turned to Discord to discuss their opinions beliefs, to organize, to advocate for change they want to see. Discord Trust & Safetyas objective is to ensure that no harm comes to our users, to society at large, because of actions taken on Discord, which is why we donat tolerate activities that promote advocate for violence. When weare reviewing reports for violent extremism, while itas sometimes clear when users servers have crossed that line, in many cases thereas a lot more context to consider. One of most difficult responsibilities of our work is balancing mitigation of potential harm without appearing as if we are overstepping any boundaries censoring meaningful conversation. Looking to Future Because of these values, we plan to continue standing firm against ideologies of hate that violent extremist communities espouse, we are excited to work with other platforms organizations that seek to do same. Stay tuned for more updates. We know that we canat solve violent extremism alone, but weall continue to do our best to make sure that communities on Discord reflect our company values. We want Discord a internet as a whole a to be a space for positive interactions creating belonging. If you would like to report dangerous harmful activity to Trust & Safety team, please do so using our report form. If youare unsure how to report a user server, take a look at dis.gd/HowToReport. How we investigate When we receive a report from a Discord user, Trust & Safety team looks through available evidence gathers as much information as possible. This investigation is centered around reported messages, but can expand if evidence shows that thereas a bigger violation. For example, we may investigate whether entire server is dedicated to bad behavior, if behavior appears to be part of a wider pattern. We spend a lot of time on this process because we believe context in which something is posted is important can change meaning entirely. We might ask reporting user for more information to help our investigation. Responding to user reports is an important part of our Trust & Safety teamas work, but we know there is also violating content on Discord that might go unreported. This is where we get proactive. Our goal is to stop bad actors their activity before anyone else encounters it. We prioritize getting rid of worst-of-the-worst content because it has absolutely no place on Discord, because risk of harm is high. We focus our efforts on exploitative content, in particular non-consensual pornography sexual content related to minors, as well as violent extremism. Please note: We do not monitor every server every conversation. Privacy is incredibly important to us we try to balance it thoughtfully with our duty to prevent harm. However, we scan images uploaded to our platform to detect child sexual abuse material. When we have data suggesting that a user is engaging in illegal activity violating our policies, we investigate their networks, activity on Discord, their messages to proactively detect accomplices determine whether violations have occurred. a a Four steps to a super safe server 1. Set up roles permissions Roles are one of building blocks of managing a Discord server. They give your members a fancy color, but more importantly, each role comes with a set of permissions that control what your members can cannot do in server. With roles, you can give members bots administrative permissions like kicking banning members, adding removing channels, pinging @everyone. You can find these options in Roles section of your Server Settings. Assign permissions with care! Certain permissions allow members to make changes to your server channels. These permissions are a great moderation tool, but be wary of who you grant this power to. Changes made to your server canat be undone. You can learn more about implementing roles permissions in Role Management 101 our Setting Up Permissions FAQ article. 2. Set a verification level Server verification levels allow you to control who can send messages in your server. Setting a high verification level is a great way to protect your server from spammers raids. You can find this option in Safety Setup section of your Server Settings. 3. Enable server-wide 2FA When enabled, server-wide two-factor authentication (2FA) requires all of your moderators administrators to have 2FA enabled on their accounts in order to take administrative actions, like deleting messages. You can read more about 2FA here. By requiring all admin accounts to have 2FA turned on, you protect your server from malicious users who might try to compromise one of your moderators' administrators' accounts then make unwanted changes to your server. If you are server owner, you can enable 2FA requirement for moderation in Safety Setup section of your Server Settings. You must have 2FA enabled on your own account before you can enable this option! 4. Explicit image filter explicit image filter automatically blocks messages in a server that may contain explicit images in channels not marked as Age-restricted. You can control this feature so that it applies to all server members, just to members without roles a you can turn this feature off altogether. Age-restricted channels are exempt from explicit image filter. Turning this filter on allows your server members to share content while reducing risk of explicit images being posted in channels that are not age-restricted. You can access this setting by navigating to Server Settings, under Moderation, select SafetySetup, then find Explicit image filter heading. What is Discord? Discord Glossary Discord has its own vocabulary. You might hear your teen students using these words when talking about Discord. Server: Servers are spaces on Discord. They are made by specific communities friend groups. vast majority of servers are small invitation-only. Some larger servers are public. Any user can start a new server for free invite their friends to it. Channel: Discord servers are organized into text voice channels, which are usually dedicated to specific topics can have different rules. DMs GDMs: Users can send private messages to other users as a direct message (DM), as well as start a voice video call. Most DMs are one-on-one conversations, but users have option to invite up to nine others to conversation to create a private group DM (GDM), with a maximum size of ten people. Group DMs are not public require an invite from someone in group to join. Go Live: users can share their screen with other people who are in a server a DM with them. Nitro: Nitro is Discordas premium subscription service. Nitro offers special perks for subscribers, such as option to customize your Discord Tag, ability to use custom emotes in every server, a higher file upload cap, discounted Server Boosts. Server Boosts: If your teen is a big fan of a community, they might want to boost communityas server (or their own). Like Nitro, Server Boosts give servers special perks like more custom emotes, better video voice quality, ability to set a custom invite link. Server Boosts can be bought with Nitro purchased separately. Student Hubs: Discord Hubs for Students allow students to verify their Discord account with their official student email, unlock access to an exclusive hub for students at their school. Within hub, they can connect with other verified students, discover servers for study groups classes, share their own servers for fellow students to join. Hubs are not affiliated with managed by a school school staff. Servers in a Hub are student-run but may include non-students. For more information on Student Hubs, please check out our Student Hubs FAQs. Why people love Discord Below, you can see just a few of our favorite stories about what people are doing on Discord why they love it. You can find even more stories about how people use Discord right here. Cyndie, a parent of two from North Carolina, reflects on how her family uses Discord: aThere are four of us we all have Discord installed on both our computers phones. My oldest son is in an apartment, younger one is on campus, so we use Discord to make family plans. Everything gets dropped into that server. From dinneras ready to internships job offers. Usually itas silly, stupid stuff we just drop in that makes us all laugh, like when thereas a Weird Al question on Jeopardy. I canat imagine life without it.a Genavieve, a high-school student from California, talks about how her classes use Discord: ""I've been using Discord for last two years as my main communication with my friends. We had too many people in our group chat wanted a platform where we could all communicate with each other. Discord is a great way for a friend group of thirty people to stay in touch! Also, with distance learning in place, Iave started using it with my AP Physics class too. It's been so important to feel connected to our teachers each other when we are so isolated in such a difficult class. Using Discord brought us closer together as a class a we are already a small class of 22 students, so being able to joke around send memes helps us not feel so alone during distance learning. different channels @mentions make it much easier to keep information straight. Screenshare makes it even easier, so we can show each other documents problems we are working on to get feedback troubleshooting advice.a David, a physics math tutor from New Jersey, talks about how he teaches students connects with other teachers over Discord: ""I use Discord to tutor one of my students to stay up to date with conversations announcements in a group of physics teachers interested in physics education research. It's nice to see a side-by-side camera view of my desk with student's work. I also really like that audio through OPUS codec which sounds very clean."" a a Reporting Abusive Behavior to Discord Reporting a Message If violation happened in a server, you can also reach out to serveras moderators, who may be able to respond immediately help resolve your concerns.

Our Approach to Content ModerationA We currently employ three levers to moderate user content on Discord, while being mindful of user privacy:A Our Community Guidelines define what is isn't okay to do on Discord. Every person on Discord should feel like their voice can be heard, but not at expense of someone else. If you come across a message that appears to break these rules, please report it to your server moderator to us. If content behavior violates our Guidelines we may take a number of enforcement actions including but not limited to issuing warnings; removing content; disabling removing accounts and/or servers responsible; reporting them to law enforcement. Learn more about our Community Guidelines here Terms of Service here. a a What actions we take When our Trust & Safety team confirms that there has been a violation of our Community Guidelines, team takes immediate steps to mitigate harm and, wherever possible, help users avoid breaking rules in future. following are actions that we might take on either users and/or servers: Discord also works with law enforcement agencies in cases of immediate danger and/or self-harm. We swiftly report child abuse material content users responsible to National Center for Missing Exploited Children. a a How You Can Appeal Our Actions Every user can appeal actions taken against their account.A While we do our best to ensure that weare only taking action when itas warranted, weare not perfect mistakes might happen. We recognize appeals are an important part of process. Just as you deserve a chance to be heard when some action is taken against you offline, you should have such a chance to be heard when action is taken against your Discord account by us. process reflects Discord's commitment to internationally recognized human rights set out in United Nations Guiding Principles on Business Human Rights (UNGPs), privacy, free expression.

Even if we canat review appeal, your feedback helps us improve these systems over time. If your teen encounters an issue Even though majority of Discord usage is in small, private, invite-only groups, we understand that there may be times when people in these groups behave in ways that make others uncomfortable post content that isnat allowed. Our Community Guidelines outline how all users should act on Discord what we allow do not allow. We recommend reviewing these with your teen so that you both know what behavior is isnat okay on platform. Among other things, we do not allow: If your teen encounters a violation of our Community Guidelines, such as harassment inappropriate content, please file a report with details that you can gather. Our Trust & Safety team strives to ensure bad users don't disrupt your teenas experience on Discord. We also provide a number of tools to ensure that teens (and everyone else) have control over their Discord experience. a a Answering parents' educators' top questions 1. Is Discord safe for my teens to use? There are a few things that make Discord a great safe place for teens: To help your teen use Discord safely, itas important to understand how Discord works how you can best control your teenas experience on it. We have listed a number of tips to do so here. Just like with every other online service, best way to ensure your teen stays safe online is to have clear guidelines on what they should shouldnat be looking at posting online, make sure that you keep clear lines of communication with them. 2. What is minimum age to be on Discord? How do you ensure teens under 13 canat create an account? Discord's Terms of Service require people to be over a minimum age to access our app website. minimum age to access Discord is 13, unless local legislation mandates an older age. To ensure that users satisfy that minimum age requirement, users are asked to confirm their date of birth upon creating an account. Learn more about how we use this age information here. If a user is reported as being under 13, we delete their account unless they can verify that they are at least 13 years old using an official ID document. 3. What personal information does Discord collect about my teen? Do you sell it? Discord does not ask for a real name when a user signs up, we do not sell user data. To learn more about what information we collect how we use this information, please see our Privacy Policy. 4. Can my teen be exposed to inappropriate content on Discord? Like on every internet platform, there is age-restricted content on Discord. Each user chooses which servers they want to join who they want to interact with. In servers, age-restricted content must be posted in a channel marked as age-restricted, which cannot be accessed by users under 18. For Direct Messages, we recommend that every user under 18 activates explicit media content filter by selecting ""Keep Me Safe"" under ""Safe Direct Messaging"" heading in Privacy & Safety section of their User Settings. When a user chooses ""Keep Me Safe"" setting, images videos in all direct messages are scanned by Discord explicit media content is blocked. We believe that best way to make sure that your teenagers are only accessing content that they should is to set clear guidelines on what they should shouldnat be looking at posting online, make sure that you keep clear lines of communication with them. 5. Can my teen interact with people they donat know on Discord? Unlike other platforms where someone might be able to message you as soon as you sign up for an account (before you have added any friends joined any servers), this isnat case on Discord. In order for another user to send a direct message (DM)A to your teen, your teen must either (1)A accept other user as a friend (2) decide to join a server that other user is a member of. Each user has control over following: Users should only accept friend requests from users that they know trust. If your teen isnat sure, thereas no harm in rejecting friend request. They can always add that user later if itas a mistake. If your teen is ever uncomfortable interacting with someone on Discord, they can always block that specific user. Blocking a user removes them from your teen's Friends List, prevents them from messaging your teen directly, hides their messages in any shared servers. 6. Are there parental controls on Discord I can use to control my teen's account? We have detailed all controls you have to help make your teenas account safer here. We recommend going through these settings together with your teen having an open conversation about why you are choosing certain settings. iOS Android operating systems offer parental controls that can help you manage your teen's phone usage, including Discord, if needed. Apple Microsoft offer similar controls for computers. 7. How can I monitor what my teen is doing on Discord? Privacy is incredibly important to us, including your teenas privacy. We canat share their login information with you, but we encourage you to discuss how to use Discord safely directly with your teen. 8. What are Student Hubs? Discord Hubs for Students allow students to verify their Discord account with their official student email, unlock access to an exclusive hub for students at their school.

Role of administrators moderators on Discord Administrators are people who create Discord servers around specific interests. They establish rules for participating, can invite people to join, oversee health well-being of their community. They have broad administrative control, can bring in moderators to manage community members. They can also ban remove members and, if necessary, remove replace moderators. Administrators also choose moderators to play a vital role in Discord communities. responsibilities of a moderator might vary, but their overall role is to ensure that their Discord server is a safe, healthy environment for everyone. They can do things like moderate delete messages, as well as invite, ban, suspend people who violate serveras rules. best moderators typically are seasoned enthusiastic participants in one more communities. Admins moderators are your first go-to when you encounter an issue in a server. They may be able to respond immediately help resolve your concerns. Each Discord server should have written rules for behavior to alleviate confusion misunderstanding about guidelines for that particular community. These rules, which supplement our Community Guidelines, are your tools to moderate efficiently transparently.

24,"Transparency Reports Discord Transparency Report: January - June 2024 We built Discord to be best communication tool for people to hang out talk together around playing their favorite games. To achieve this mission, we know that Discord must be a safe space for our users. Thatas why safety is integrated into every aspect of our product policies, why about 15% of all Discord employees are dedicated to this work. Community Guidelines Enforcement Discord publishes maintains a comprehensive set of Community Guidelines that explains what content behavior is is not allowed on platform. Our Policy Hub expands on these Guidelines, providing more information about our policies. Combating harmful behavior requires industry-wide collaboration. Discord is deeply committed to making internet Discord safer, both through our own proactive interventions with our various partners. We invest in proactive measures to detect remove content that violates our policies by leveraging advanced tooling, machine learning, specialized teams, we partner with external industry experts. We also make it easy for people to report violative content behavior, we encourage users, moderators, our Safety Reporting Network to submit reports directly to our team. We investigate these reports may take a number of enforcement actions including, but not limited to: issuing warnings; temporarily suspending an account; temporarily limiting certain features of an account; removing content; disabling removing accounts and/or servers responsible; reporting them to law enforcement when applicable. This report details actions Discord has taken on accounts servers that have violated our Community Guidelines Terms of Service. Transparency Reporting at Discord This Transparency Report is our fifteenth since 2019. During this time, weave evolved structure of our reports in order to provide most accurate holistic report of work we do. Weare making a number of changes in this report to reflect just that. First, weare shifting cadence of publication from quarterly to semiannual to provide a more cohesive narrative of all of work we do to keep people safe. This report covers first half of 2024, from January through June. This report also includes new data from our Warning System, a tool that provides more transparency about interventions we take to help users who violate our rules learn how to do better in future. As a result of introduction of Warning System, we've also made changes to better reflect our updated, holistic approach to moderation. For example, this report no longer counts how many servers were proactively removed because that number is not effective at assessing full impact of our safety operations. As we learn more about ways in which Warning System changes landscape of actions we take, our approach will evolve, weall continue providing level of transparency that we strive to maintain. These updates demonstrate our commitment to expanding actions we take to enforce our Community Guidelines in an updated fairer way. Some violations are more serious than others, weall take appropriate action depending on severity of violation. When appropriate, we focus less on disabling accounts servers at outset, instead add more opportunities to learn our rules. We also let users know how their violations may impact their overall account standing provide information on how to avoid further violations more significant actions being taken on their accounts.

BSD License is recommended for most projects. It is simple easy to understand it places almost no restrictions on what you can do with Forge project. If GPL suits your project better you are also free to use Forge under that license. You don't have to do anything special to choose one license other you don't have to notify anyone which license you are using. You are free to use this project in commercial projects as long as copyright header is left intact. If you are a commercial entity use this set of libraries in your commercial software then reasonable payment to Digital Bazaar, if you can afford it, is not required but is expected would be appreciated. If this library saves you time, then it's saving you money. cost of developing Forge software was on order of several hundred hours tens of thousands of dollars. We are attempting to strike a balance between helping development community while not being taken advantage of by lucrative commercial entities for our efforts. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- New BSD License (3-clause) Copyright (c) 2010, Digital Bazaar, Inc.

By contrast, GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share change free software--to make sure software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of Free Software Foundation's software to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code can get it if you want it, that you can change software use pieces of it in new free programs; that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights to ask you to surrender rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of software, if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis for a fee, you must give recipients all rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive can get source code. you must show them these terms so they know their rights. We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright software, (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify software. Also, for each author's protection ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If software is modified by someone else passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on original authors' reputations. Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use not licensed at all. precise terms conditions for copying, distribution modification follow. GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION MODIFICATION Activities other than copying, distribution modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. act of running Program is not restricted, output from Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on Program (independent of having been made by running Program). Whether that is true depends on what Program does. You may charge a fee for physical act of transferring a copy, you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. You may modify your copy copies of Program any portion of it, thus forming a work based on Program, copy distribute such modifications work under terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) You must cause modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed files date of any change. b) You must cause any work that you distribute publish, that in whole in part contains is derived from Program any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under terms of this License. c) If modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in most ordinary way, to print display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) that users may redistribute program under these conditions, telling user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on Program is not required to print an announcement.) These requirements apply to modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from Program, can be reasonably considered independent separate works in themselves, then this License, its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on Program, distribution of whole must be on terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to entire whole, thus to each every part regardless of who wrote it. Thus, it is not intent of this section to claim rights contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, intent is to exercise right to control distribution of derivative collective works based on Program. In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on Program with Program (or with a work based on Program) on a volume of a storage distribution medium does not bring other work under scope of this License. You may copy distribute Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code executable form under terms of Sections 1 2 above provided that you also do one of following: a) Accompany it with complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under terms of Sections 1 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of corresponding source code, to be distributed under terms of Sections 1 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, c) Accompany it with information you received as to offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution only if you received program in object code executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) source code for a work means preferred form of work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus scripts used to control compilation installation of executable. However, as a special exception, source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source binary form) with major components (compiler, kernel, so on) of operating system on which executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies executable. If distribution of executable object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy source code from same place counts as distribution of source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy source along with object code. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense distribute Program is void, will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify distribute Program its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying distributing Program (or any work based on Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, all its terms conditions for copying, distributing modifying Program works based on it. Each time you redistribute Program (or any work based on Program), recipient automatically receives a license from original licensor to copy, distribute modify Program subject to these terms conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on recipients' exercise of rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License. If, as a consequence of a court judgment allegation of patent infringement for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement otherwise) that contradict conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of Program by all those who receive copies directly indirectly through you, then only way you could satisfy both it this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of Program. If any portion of this section is held invalid unenforceable under any particular circumstance, balance of section is intended to apply section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. It is not purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents other property right claims to contest validity of any such claims; this section has sole purpose of protecting integrity of free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to author/donor to decide if he she is willing to distribute software through any other system a licensee cannot impose that choice. This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of rest of this License. If distribution and/or use of Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents by copyrighted interfaces, original copyright holder who places Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates limitation as if written in body of this License. Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it ""any later version"", you have option of following terms conditions either of that version of any later version published by Free Software Foundation. If Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by Free Software Foundation. If you wish to incorporate parts of Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by Free Software Foundation, write to Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by two goals of preserving free status of all derivatives of our free software of promoting sharing reuse of software generally. BECAUSE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR PROGRAM, TO EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE PROGRAM ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. ENTIRE RISK AS TO QUALITY PERFORMANCE OF PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR CORRECTION. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF USE INABILITY TO USE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU THIRD PARTIES A FAILURE OF PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. following software may be included in this product: node-int64.

All code authors, representatives of companies they work for, have signed affidavits dedicating their contributions to public domain originals of those signed affidavits are stored in a firesafe at main offices of Hwaci. Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, distribute original SQLite code, either in source code form as a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial non-commercial, by any means. previous paragraph applies to deliverable code documentation in SQLite - those parts of SQLite library that you actually bundle ship with a larger application. Some scripts used as part of build process (for example ""configure"" scripts generated by autoconf) might fall under other open-source licenses. Nothing from these build scripts ever reaches final deliverable SQLite library, however, so licenses associated with those scripts should not be a factor in assessing your rights to copy use SQLite library. All of deliverable code in SQLite has been written from scratch. No code has been taken from other projects from open internet. Every line of code can be traced back to its original author, all of those authors have public domain dedications on file. So SQLite code base is clean is uncontaminated with licensed code from other projects. Open-Source, not Open-Contribution SQLite is open-source, meaning that you can make as many copies of it as you want do whatever you want with those copies, without limitation. But SQLite is not open-contribution. project does not accept patches. Only 27 individuals have ever contributed any code to SQLite, of those only 16 still have traces in latest release. Only 3 developers have contributed non-comment changes within previous five years 96.4% of latest release code was written by just two people. (The statistics in this paragraph were gathered on 2018-02-05.) Furthermore, all of code in SQLite is original, having been written specifically for use by SQLite. No code has been copied from unknown sources on internet. Many people associated ""open-source"" software with software that has grown organically through contributions from countless individuals. And, indeed, there is some open-source software that works that way. But not SQLite. SQLite uses cathedral development philosopy not bazaar approach. All of SQLite code has been written by people who are well known to each other. Warranty of Title SQLite is in public domain does not require a license. Even so, some organizations want legal proof of their right to use SQLite. Circumstances where this occurs include following: Your company desires indemnity against claims of copyright infringement. You are using SQLite in a jurisdiction that does not recognize public domain. You are using SQLite in a jurisdiction that does not recognize right of an author to dedicate their work to public domain. You want to hold a tangible legal document as evidence that you have legal right to use distribute SQLite. Your legal department tells you that you have to purchase a license. If any of above circumstances apply to you, Hwaci, company that employs all developers of SQLite, will sell you a Warranty of Title for SQLite. A Warranty of Title is a legal document that asserts that claimed authors of SQLite are true authors, that authors have legal right to dedicate SQLite to public domain, that Hwaci will vigorously defend against challenges to those claims. All proceeds from sale of SQLite Warranties of Title are used to fund continuing improvement support of SQLite. Contributed Code In order to keep SQLite completely free unencumbered by copyright, project does not accept patches. If you would like to make a suggested change, include a patch as a proof-of-concept, that would be great. However please do not be offended if we rewrite your patch from scratch. pugixml This library is available to anybody free of charge, under terms of MIT License: Copyright (c) 2006-2018 Arseny Kapoulkine Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software associated documentation files (the ""Software""), to deal in Software without restriction, including without limitation rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of Software, to permit persons to whom Software is furnished to do so, subject to following conditions: above copyright notice this permission notice shall be included in all copies substantial portions of Software.

Our newly-implemented partnerships resources developed with support of Crisis Text Line, Digital Wellness Lab, National PTA are an important addition to our ongoing work to give everyone power to create space to find belonging in their lives. Building a Safer Place for Teens to Hang Out Choose what you see who you want to hang with Introducing our new Teen Safety Assist initiative: Teen Safety Assist is focused on further protecting teens by introducing a new series of features, including multiple safety alerts sensitive content filters that will be default enabled for teen users. Starting next week, weare excited to release first two features of Teen Safety Assist initiative. Teens have shared that they like tools that help them avoid unwanted direct messages (DMs) media. To support this, weare rolling out safety alerts on senders sensitive content filters that automatically blur media that may be sensitive a even if sender doesnat initially blur it with a spoiler tag.A a Weave partnered with technology non-profit Thorn to design these features together based on their guidance on teen online safety behaviors what works best to help protect teens. Our partnership has focused on empowering teens to take control over safety how best to guide teens to helpful tips resources. Weare grateful for support of Thorn to ensure we build right protections empower teens with tools resources they need to have a safer online experience. first two features of Teen Safety initiative will start rolling out globally in November 2023 will be turned on by default for teen users. Stay tuned for many more features from this initiative as we look ahead to next year. Work together to keep each other safe We know mistakes happen rules are accidentally broken. Our new Warning System includes multiple touchpoints so users can easily understand rule violations consequences. These touchpoints provide more transparency into Discord interventions, letting users know how their violation may impact their overall account standing gives information for them to do better in future. We built this system so users can learn how to do better in future help keep all hangouts safe.A Some violations are more serious than others, weall take appropriate action depending on severity of violation. For example, we have will continue to have a zero-tolerance policy towards violent extremism content that sexualizes children. Warning System is built based on our teen-centric policies. This is a multi-year, focused effort to invest more deeply holistically into our teen safety efforts. We incorporate teen-centric philosophies in how we enforce our policies, assess risks of new products with Safety by Design, communicate our policies in an age-appropriate manner. For Warning System, this means that we consider how teens are growing, learning, taking age-appropriate risks as they mature, we give them more opportunities to learn from mistakes rather than punish them harshly. Warning System starts rolling out today in select regions. Stay tuned for many more updates to our Warning System in future. a For our server moderators admins, weave recently expanded their safety toolkit with new features that allow them to proactively identify potentially unsafe activity, such as server raids DM spam, take swift actions as needed.A We began rolling these tools in September to Community Servers, now weare rolling them out to all servers. You choose what stays private While you might be an open book with your friends, having your personal business out there for everyone to see can feel a bit weird. Thatas why you get to decide, from server to server, how much you want to share how easy it is to contact you. With Server Profiles, you can adjust to how you present yourself in different spaces, allowing you to be as much of real ayoua as you feel comfortable being in any particular group.A You can also always try turning on Message Requests: a feature that sends any DM from someone new into a separate inbox requires your approval before that user can DM you again. Or, go extra mile turn off DMs entirely from server members unless youave explicitly added them to your friends list. Weave got you PHEW, okaya that was a lot. Thanks for stickina around jamming through our most recent updates with us. Everything you could ever want to know about safety privacy on Discord, even more if youare learning type of person, lives in our Safety Library a check it out for more tips on making Discord safe comfortable for you. a This article was first published on 10/24/2023. Building a better place to play chill together as teens go back to school Building with teens, for teens At Discord, weare constantly working to make our platform best place for our users, including teens, to hang out with their friends online. An important part of doing this right way is listening to teen users' concerns ideas directly. Since end of 2023, weave conducted 30 focus groups globally to speak with teens about their firsthand experiences perspectives on how to shape Discordas features to meet their needs. We collected ideas from teens global organizations specializing in teen safety a like Digital Wellness Lab, NoFiltras Youth Innovation Council, ThinkYoung a to create an aspirational charter that helps us understand how teens want to feel on Discord. We learned about what tools a like muting a conversation tailoring who can send you a friend request a are most helpful for teens to remediate uncomfortable situations. We also heard new ideas for additional safety privacy features that have helped shape our product focus. A Teen Charter for a better place to hang out Teens have spoken, we have taken what they said to heart. We learned a ton when speaking with our teen users, weare excited to reveal our co-created Teen Charter. Teen Charter outlines principles that matter most to them: authenticity, inclusivity, privacy, transparency. This set of principles represents expectations teens have of each other of Discord.a While our Community Guidelines explain what is what isnat allowed on Discord, we hope Teen Charter principles will ultimately guide users to take on a shared responsibility in creating a fun comfortable space to play chill with their friends. These principles will also help inform product policy improvements on Discord, serving as a guiding beacon for us to help teen users thrive.A We want to help teens forge maintain genuine friendships, we know that can only happen when they feel safe connecting with one another on our platform. A starting point for guardians parents Weare excited to announce launch of our Guardianas Guide to help guardians parents better understand Discord, how platform works, equip them with tools needed to check in with teens start conversations about building positive online behaviors.a We know guardians have a lot of great resources to help their teens navigate online world, but we wanted to provide a resource about Discord, from Discord. Guardianas Guide is a centralized asset that helps adults who are raising teens understand latest highlights of how Discord works, information on how their teen might spend time on Discord, shares tips resources to talk to teens about keeping their online experiences comfortable. We consistently offer updated info on our Safety Center, but this resource helps streamline these topics. Send your teen back to school in style by entering our giveaway Weare excited about resources we shared today. Like, really excited.

Start new school year with some Discord flare!a To learn more about how we approach safety privacy here at Discord, we have plenty of more resources in our regularly-updated Safety Center. Calling all Discord Moderators Community Managers! Clarifying our Dangerous Regulated Goods Policy Existing Dangerous Regulated Goods Policy Our guidelines state that users may not organize, promote, engage in buying, selling, trading of dangerous regulated goods. This has always been our policy will not be changing. We want to use this opportunity to talk a little bit more about what we consider to be a adangerous regulated gooda how this policy will apply: Examples Exceptions To help put this policy into context, here are some examples of situations we would would not take action against under this policy: Enforcing Existing Policy We may take any number of enforcement actions in response to users servers that are attempting to buy, sell, trade dangerous regulated goods on Discord a including warning an account, server, entire moderator team; removing harmful content; permanently suspending an account server. Looking Ahead After receiving feedback from our community, we are evaluating potential for unintended consequences negative impacts of age-restricted requirement. Our existing guidelines on Dangerous Regulated Goods remain as stated, however we are assessing how best to support server moderators regarding age-restricted requirement to ensure we are not preventing positive online engagement. We regularly evaluate assess our policies to ensure Discord remains a safe welcoming place, plan to update our Community Guidelines in coming months. We will provide any important updates on this policy then. full list of content behaviors not allowed on Discord can be found in our Community Guidelines. Our Safety Center Policy & Safety Blog are also great resources if you would like to read more about our approach to safety our policies. Defending Your Online Spaces Editor's Note: On July 1 2024, Supreme Court reaffirmed that moderation decisions are protected by First Amendment of U.S. Constitution. You can read our response to this ruling here. Today, Discord filed an amicus brief with Supreme Court in support of our ongoing efforts to create online communities of shared interests that are safe, welcoming, inclusive. cases at issue (Moody v. NetChoice, et al. NetChoice et al. v. Paxton) challenge constitutionality of two new laws in Texas Florida. You may have heard of them: these laws would significantly restrict ability of online services to remove content that is objectionableA to their users force them to keep a wide range of alawful but awfula content on their sites. Discord is not a traditional social media service, but whether intended not, laws are broad enough to likely impact services like ours. Itas hard to overstate potential impact if these laws are allowed to go into effect: they would fundamentally change how services like Discord operate, with that, experiences we deliver to you. Thereas no doubt that outcome here is hugely important to us as a company, but that alone is not why we are taking a stand. Ultimately, we filed this brief because important context was missing from official record: you all vibrant communities youave built on Discord. Taking a step back, Discord has invested heavily in creating safe fun online spaces. Our Community Guidelines set rules for how we all engage on Discord, we put a lot of effort into enforcing them: around 15% of company works on safety, including content moderation. This includes Trust Safety agents who enforce Discordas rules, engineers who develop moderation tools for both Discord its users, many more dedicated individuals across our company. We do this work so that you can create those online spaces where you can find foster genuine connection. But in order to bring this world to life, Discord needs to be able to prevent, detect, remove harmful speech conduct. Barring companies like Discord from moderating content is a little like barring garbage collection in a city: every individual block would have to devote its own resources to hauling its own garbage, diverting those limited resources from more productive activities individualized curation that makes each neighborhood unique. So, while our rules content moderation efforts certainly reflect our own values speech about kind of services we want to offer, we really do it for you allawe work to take care of hard stuff so you all can focus on creating communities you want. Thatas why we decided to take such a strong position in these cases: we want to make sure Supreme Court understands how these laws would impact your speech your communities. Fortunately, First Amendment has a lot to say about thisait protects your association rights, which make it possible for you to come together around your shared interests see content that is relevant helpful, not harmful.A Keeping your communities fun safe by not allowing harmful content is a top priority for us. We wouldnat be doing what we do without all of you, we will keep working to make sure you can create online spaces you want.A A Discordas Commitment to Teen Child Safety Our Policies You can read an overview of following policies here. Teen Self-Endangerment Policy Teen self-endangerment is a nuanced issue that we do not take lightly. We want our teen users to be able to express themselves freely on Discord while also taking steps to ensure these users donat engage in risky behaviors that might endanger their safety well-being. In order to help our teenage users stay safe, our policies state that users under age of 18 are not allowed to send access any sexually explicit content. Even when this kind of content is shared consensually between teens, there is a risk that self-generated sexual media can be saved shared outside of their private conversations. We want to help our users avoid finding themselves in these situations. In this context, we also believe that dating online can result in self-endangerment. Under this policy, teen dating servers are prohibited on Discord we will take action against users who are engaging in this behavior. Additionally, older teens engaging in grooming of a younger teen will be reviewed actioned under our Inappropriate Sexual Conduct with Children Grooming Policy. Through our thorough work partnership with a prominent child safety organization, we determined that we will, when possible, warn teens who have engaged in sexually explicit behavior before moving to a full ban. An example of this includes teens sharing explicit content with each other that is not their own content. Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) Child Sexualization Policy Discord has a zero-tolerance policy for child sexual abuse, which does not have a place on ourA platform a anywhere in society. We do not allow CSAM on Discord, including AI-generated photorealistic CSAM. When such imagery is found, imagery is reported to National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC). This ensures that sexualization of children in any context is not normalized by bad actors. Inappropriate Sexual Conduct with Teens Grooming Policy Discord has a zero-tolerance policy for inappropriate sexual conduct with children grooming. Grooming is inappropriate sexual contact between adults teens on platform, with special attention given to predatory behaviors such as online enticement sexual extortion of children, commonly referred to as asextortion.a When we become aware of these types of incidents, we take appropriate action, including banning accounts of offending adult users reporting them to NCMEC, which subsequently works with local law enforcement.A How We Work to Keep Our Younger Users Safe Our Safety team works hard to find remove abhorrent, harmful content, take action including banning users responsible engaging with proper authorities. Discordas Safety by Design practice includes a risk assessment process during product development cycle that helps identify mitigate potential risks to user safety. We recognize that teens have unique vulnerabilities in online settings this process allows us to better safeguard their experience. Through this process, we think carefully about how product features might disproportionately impact teens consider whether product facilitates more teen-to-adult interactions and/or any unintended harm. Our teams identify strategize ways to mitigate safety risks with internal safety technology solutions during this process through getting insight recommendations from external partners. Discord uses a mix of proactive reactive tools to remove content that violates our policies, from use of advanced technology like machine learning models PhotoDNA image hashing to partnering with community moderators to uphold our policies providing in-platform reporting mechanisms to surface violations. Our Terms of Service require people to be over a minimum age (13, unless local legislation mandates an older age) to access our website. We use an age gate that asks users to provide their date of birth upon creating an account. If a user is reported as being under 13, we delete their account. Users can only appeal to restore their account by providing an official ID document to verify their age.A Additionally, we require that all age-restricted content is placed in a channel clearly labeled as age-restricted, which triggers an age gate, preventing users under 18 from accessing that content. newest launches of safety products are focused on helping to safeguard teen experience with our safety alerts on senders that educate teens on ways they can control their experience limit unwanted contact. Additionally, sensitive content filters provide additional controls for teens to blur block unwanted content. Rather than assigning prescriptive solutions for teens, we aim to empower teens with respect for their agency, privacy, decision-making power. Additionally, we are expanding our own Trusted Reporter Network in collaboration with INHOPE for direct communication with expert third parties, including researchers, industry peers, journalists for intelligence sharing. Our Technology Solutions Machine learning has proven to be an essential component of safety solutions at Discord. Since our acquisition of Sentropy, a leader in AI-powered moderation systems, we have continued to balance technology with judgment contextual assessment of highly trained employees, along with continuing to maintain our strong stance on user privacy. Below is an overview of some of our key investments in technology: Teen Safety Assist: Teen Safety Assist is focused on further protecting teens by introducing a new series of features, including multiple safety alerts sensitive content filters that will be default-enabled for teen users. Safety Rules Engine: Safety Rules Engine allows our teams to evaluate user activities on platform, including registrations, server joins, other metadata. We then analyze patterns of problematic behavior to make informed decisions take uniform actions like user challenges bans. AutoMod: Automod is a powerful tool for community moderators to automatically filter unwanted messages with certain keywords, block profiles that may be impersonating a server admin appear harmful to their server, detect harmful messages using machine learning. This technology empowers community moderators to keep their communities safe without having to spend long hours manually reviewing removing unwanted content on their servers. Visual safety platform: Discord has continued to invest in improving image classifiers for content such as sexual, gore, violent media. With these, our machine learning models are being improved to reach higher precision detection rates with lower error rates decrease teen exposure to potentially inappropriate mature content. We proactively scan images uploaded to our platform using PhotoDNA to detect child sexual abuse material (CSAM) report any CSAM content perpetrators to NCMEC, who subsequently work with local law enforcement to take appropriate action. Investing in technological advancements tools to proactively detect CSAM grooming is a key priority for us, we have a dedicated team to handle related content. In Q2 2023, we proactively removed 99% of servers found to be hosting CSAM. You can find more information in Discordas latest Transparency Report. There is constant innovation taking place within beyond Discord to improve how companies can effectively scale deliver content moderation. Our approach will continue to evolve as time goes on, as weare constantly finding new ways to do better for our users. Partnerships We know that collaboration is important, weare continuously working with experts partners so that we have a holistic informed approach to combating sexual exploitation of children. Weare grateful to collaborate with Tech Coalition NoFiltr to help young people stay safer on Discord.A With our new series of products under Teen Safety Assist initiative, Discord has launched a safety alert for teens to help flag when a teen might want to double-check that they want to reply to a particular new direct message. Weave partnered with technology non-profit Thorn to design these features together based on their guidance on teen online safety behaviors what works best to help protect teens. Our partnership is focused on empowering teens to take control over safety how best to guide teens to helpful tips resources. Additional Resources Want to learn more about Discordas safety work? Check out these resources below: We look forward to continuing this important work deepening our partnerships to ensure we continue to have a holistic nuanced approach to teen child safety. Evolving our Policies to Keep You Safe Threats, Hate Speech, Violent Extremism Hate harm targeted at individuals communities is not tolerated on Discord in any way, combating this behavior content is a top priority for us. We evolved our Threats Policy to address threats of harm to others. Under this policy, we will take action against direct indirect threats, veiled threats, those who encourage this behavior, conditional statements to cause harm. We also refined our Hate Speech Policy with input from a group of experts who study identity intersectionality came from a variety of different identities backgrounds themselves. Under this policy, we define ahate speecha as any form of expression that denigrates, vilifies, dehumanizes; promotes intense, irrational feelings of enmity hatred; incites harm against people based on protected characteristics. In addition, weave expanded our list of protected characteristics to go beyond what most hate speech laws cover to include following: age; caste; color; disability; ethnicity; family responsibilities; gender; gender identity; housing status; national origin; race; refugee immigration status; religious affiliation; serious illness; sex; sexual orientation; socioeconomic class status; source of income; status as a victim of domestic violence, sexual violence, stalking; and, weight size. A Last year, we wrote about how we address Violent Extremism on Discord. We are deeply committed to our work in this space have updated our Violent Extremism Policy to prohibit any kind of support, promotion, organization of violent extremist groups ideologies. We worked closely with a violent extremism subject-matter expert to update this policy will continue to work with third-party organizations like Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism European Union Internet Forum to ensure it is enforced properly. Financial Scams, Fraud Services, Malicious Conduct During 2022, we invested significantly in how we combat criminal activity on Discord. In February, we released two blogs to help users identify protect themselves against scams on Discord. Alongside these, we developed a Financial Scams Policy which prohibits three types of common scams: identity scams, investment scams, financial scams. We will take action against users who scam others use Discord to coordinate scamming operations. In case of users who have been victim of fraudulent activity, we recommend they report activity to Discord contact law enforcement, who will be able to follow up with us for more information if it helps their investigation. Under our new Fraud Services Policy, we've expanded our definitions of what constitutes fraudulent behavior. We will take action against users who engage in reselling stolen ill-gotten digital goods are involved in coordinated efforts to defraud businesses engage in price gouging, forgery, money laundering. We also do not allow any kind of activity that could damage compromise security of an account, computer network, system under our updated Malicious Conduct Policy. We will take action against users who use Discord to host distribute malware, carry out phishing attempts denial-of-service attacks against others. Whatas Next User safety is our top priority weare committed to ensuring Discord continues to be a safe welcoming place. We regularly evaluate assess our policies in collaboration with experts, industry-leading groups, partner organizations. We look forward to continuing our work in this important area plan to share further updates down road. How Discord Prevents Removes Spam We invested a substantial amount of time resources into combating spam in 2022, disabling 141,087,602 accounts for spam spam-related offenses, with a proactive removal rate of 99%, before we receive a user report. We observed a significant increase in number of accounts disabled during third quarter of 2022, leading to an elevated but lower fourth quarter, then to a substantial decrease in first quarter of 2023. These trends can be attributed to both increased ongoing investments in our anti-spam team a shift in our approach to reducing number of disabled accounts by placing greater confidence in our proactive spam mitigations avoiding false positives. As a result, only .004% of accounts disabled submitted an appeal during past quarter. Spammers are constantly evolving adapting to new technologies methods of detection, moving to use new parts of platform to target users. Combating spam requires a multi-faceted approach that employs new tools technologies, while also remaining vigilant adaptable to changing trends. We're constantly updating our approach to remove spam, as our proactive efforts have increased, we've observed a steady decline in number of reports we receive for spam. a above trends were made possible over past year due to a number of technological advances in both back-end front-end features, products, tools to help prevent remove spam from Discord. Discord is committed to combating spam building a safer environment for people to find belonging. We've grown our teams, shipped new features, products, tools, continue to listen closely to users about how spam impacts their experience on Discord. We're constantly updating our approach to remove spam remain vigilant adaptable to changing trends. We will continue to prioritize safety work hard to combat spam in order to help make Discord best place for people communities to hang out online. How We Leverage Machine Learning to Fight Child Sexual Abuse Material Weare bridging a key gap in CSAM detection To understand how tech industry is working to solve these challenges, itas helpful to understand technology itself. industry standard for CSAM detection is a tool called PhotoDNA, which was developed by Microsoft donated to National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC)athe nationally recognized hub for reporting suspected online child sexual exploitation in US. When imagery depicting child sexual abuse is reported to NCMEC, PhotoDNA is used to create a unique digital signature (or ahasha) of that image. That hashaand not illegal imagery itselfais stored in a database that serves as a reference point for online detection efforts. At Discord, we proactively scan images using hashing algorithms (including PhotoDNA) to detect known CSAM. For example, if someone uploads an image that matches against known CSAM that has been previously reported, we automatically detect it, remove it, flag it for internal review. When we confirm that someone attempted to share illegal imagery, we remove content, permanently ban them from our platform, report them to NCMEC, who subsequently works with law enforcement.A There are more than 6.3 million hashes of CSAM in NCMECas hash database more than 29 million hashes of CSAM contained in databases from around world. That gives tech industry a strong foundation for stopping spread of this harmful material on our platforms. But thereas one key limitation: it only detects exact similar copies of images that are already logged in database. This means that predatory actors will try to exploit this weakness with unknown CSAM that has yet to be seen logged, indicating that there is either a likelihood of active abuse, images were synthetically generated using AI. Machine learning helps us stop CSAM at scale Unknown CSAM has continually plagued our industry our team felt it was important to advance our own detection capabilities. We started with an open-source model that can analyze images to understand what they are depicting. Our engineers experimented found that we could use this model to not only determine how similar one image is to another, but due to semantic understanding of model, it also demonstrated promising results for novel CSAM detection. When we find a match, we follow same process that we use for PhotoDNA matches: A human reviews it to verify if it is an instance of CSAM. If it is, itas reported to NCMEC added to PhotoDNA database. From that point, newly verified image can be detected automatically across platforms. This speeds up review process, expands database of known CSAM, makes everyone better faster at blocking CSAM over time. This is a major advancement in effort to detect, report, stop spread of CSAM. At a recent Tech Coalition hackathon, engineers from Discord other tech companies collaborated on ways we can work together to identify new forms of CSAM that evade existing detection methods. During this collaboration, we were able to work to make AI-powered detection mechanism we built open-source. At Discord, we believe safety shouldnat be proprietary a competitive advantage. Our hope is that by making this technology open source, we can bring new capabilities protections to all tech platforms, especially newer companies that donat yet have established trust safety teams. This is part of our work alongside Lantern program, which is committed to stopping people from evading CSAM detection across platforms. Together, weare working to increase prevention detection methods, accelerate identification processes, share information on predatory tactics, strengthen our collective reporting to authorities. Ultimately, this is an ideal use of machine learning technology. Itas important to note, though, that human expertise judgment is still involved. Our expert staff continues to review anything thatas not an exact match with PhotoDNA, because stakes are high we need to get it right. What matters most is that combined efforts of machine learning human expertise are making it harder than ever for predatory actors to evade detection. Weare working to build a safer internet. Itas in our DNA. Safety is a top priority at Discord. Itas reflected in our personnel: roughly 15% of our staff is dedicated to safety. These teams work to ensure our platform, features, policies result in a positive safe place for our users to hang out build community. Weare stronger together safety landscape is continually shifting. There are always new challenges emerging, no single entity can tackle them alone. Our industry can lead by sharing tools, intelligence, best practices. We also need to work collaboratively with policymakers, advocacy groups, academics to fully understand emerging threats respond to them. Initiatives like Lantern organizations like Tech Coalition represent kind of collaborative efforts that make it possible for us all to better stay ahead of bad actors work together towards a universally safe online experience for everyone. How We Put Safety at Center of Everything We Build What it means to start with safety As soon as we start building something new, we assess risks that might come from it. By starting at concept phase, we can factor safety into everything we do as we design, build, launch, manage a new product. Throughout process, our teams weigh in with specialized knowledge in their domains, including teen safety, counter-extremism, cybercrime, security, privacy, spam. Functionally, this is how we pinpoint any gaps that may exist as we build products features that make Discord a fun, safe place to hang out with friends. Four key questions for building safer products Any time we build something, we prioritize four key questions to determine our approach to building safer products: There are some things we consider with each product. Weall look, for instance, at our data to learn more about most common kinds of violations that are related to what weare building. That can help us understand most harmful most abundant violations we know about today. But our products donat all have same behaviors content, so we canat just copy-paste our work from one tool to another. Think of Family Center voice messages, for example. They have unique purposes functions, so we needed different answers to each of questions above as we built them. By starting with these questions on day one, we were able to make right decisions for each tool at each step of process maximize our approach to safety in end. By following this approach, everyone involved in making our products has a clear-eyed honest understanding of risks that could potentially arise from our work. We make intentional decisions to minimize those risks commit to only releasing something if it meets our high standard of safety. What starting with safety looks like in practice Letas look a little deeper at voice messages, feature that lets you record audio on your phone easily send it to your friends. Hereas a brief rundown of how we incorporated safety conversations into every aspect of bringing this fun tool to life. At earliest stage, product team drew up preliminary specifications consulted with trust safety subject matter experts on staff. product manager shared specs with individuals from policy legal teams, with a focus on flagging any concerns discrepancies regarding Discordas own policies. Once initial feedback was incorporated, product manager created an action plan, bringing on engineers who began building feature. Even during this stage, safety experts were part of process. In fact, it was here that members of safety team called for an additional requirementaa way for us to handle large amounts of audio messages. Just as users can report written messages, they also can report audio messages for content that violates our policies. Our safety teams needed to ensure we had a way to review those reports effectively as they flow in. In this instance, team had to figure out how audio review process would even work. Would reviewers have to sit listen to hours of reported messages each day? That didnat seem viable, so core team decided to use existing text tools that could transcribe reported messages. Now reviewers can evaluate text quickly, review audio for additional context. Once again, product manager engineers worked closely with safety team to include building in this additional layer of safety. Just because our voice messages feature is live doesnat mean our safety job is complete. We need to understand how effective our methods are, so weave developed metrics that track safety give us insight into impacts of decisions weave made. We track, for instance, if we have unusual rates of flagged content appeals on decisions, as well as breakdown of various violations on our platform. We summarize these metrics in our quarterly Transparency Reports. What it doesnat look like To better understand our safety-centric approach, consider alternative. A different platform could start with an innovative idea best intentions. It could build product it thinks would be most exciting for users, review risk safety implications when itas ready to go live. If company identifies risks at a late stage, it has to decide what to address before releasing product to world. This can happen is flawed. If youare already at finish line when you notice risks youave created, you might realize you have to start over to do it right. Building a product this way is risky, users are ones most exposed to those risks. How Discord starts with safety At Discord, we understand that we have to think about safety growth holistically. Discord is built differently from other platforms. We don't chase virality impressions. Discord makes money by providing users a great experience through premium subscriptions. Under this model, we can focus on our users have more freedom to prioritize safety. Put simply, weare only interested in growing a platform thatas safe. Weare here to help people forge genuine friendships, we know that can only happen when people feel safe connecting with one another. How Weare Fighting Spammers on Discord Important Policy Updates Important Policy Updates Joining Forces to Create a Safer Internet Recognizing Safer Internet Day Safer Internet Day was created by advocacy organizations as a way to raise awareness around online safety. It has since expanded into an opportunity for industry, government, civil society to come together to share online safety digital well-being best practices. Making internet a better, safer place for everyone is a tall task a we know we canat do it alone. Last year, as part of our ongoing partnership with National Parent Teacher Association, we co-hosted an event featuring some of our teen moderators talking about belonging mental health in online spaces. Weave continued this partnership with PTA Connected: Build up Belong Program. This program helps families explore use of technology as a communication relationship tool, discusses ways to build belonging positive communities in our digital world, teaches how to navigate privacy safety on digital platforms, helps families have interactive conversations about online scenarios, experiences expectations. Weare committed to helping build a safer internet on Safer Internet Day beyond. To continue that mission, Discord has partnered with several international leaders in online safety space. Our Work with NoFiltr This year, weare teaming up with NoFiltr to help educate Discord users on importance of safer internet practices to empower people to use Discord other platforms in a smart healthy manner. One of ways weall be working together is by engaging with NoFiltras Youth Innovation Council to co-develop educational resources that connect to users where they are. For this yearas Safer Internet Day, Discord NoFiltr, with help from Youth Innovation Council, are launching aWhatas Your Online Digital Role?a quiz. We believe that everyone can play a part in helping make online communities a safe inclusive space, this interactive quiz can help you figure out what role best suits you when it comes to being a part of building a safe community. Take quiz here to find out. International Partnerships Public Policy Roundtable Discord is partnering with Childnet UK Internet Sans Crainte, two European Safer Internet Centers dedicated to increasing awareness education about better online safety practices for youth. In addition, weall be hosting a roundtable event in Brussels where policymakers, civil society thought leaders, industry partners will come together to share insights, discuss challenges, discuss steps we can take together to make Discord internet a safer place for young people. Engaging our Communities with Educational Activities We also wanted to provide materials tools that everyone can use to help facilitate healthy open conversation about online safety a itas not so easy approaching difficult sensitive topics when it comes to talking about your experiences online. To help kick start these important discussions in a more approachable way, weave made a print-at-home fortune teller filled with questions icebreaker prompts that can help you lead a conversation about better digital health safer online practices. Interested in your own Safer Internet Day fortune teller? Check out our Safer Internet Day home page on Discordas Safety Center, where you can print out assemble your very own fortune teller. Weall be showcasing how to use this resource with our communities as part of our Safer Internet Day celebration. Discord Town Hall Public Event Weall be celebrating Safer Internet Day in publicly-joinable Discord Town Hall server with an event all about Safety, including a walk-through of fortune teller activity. You can join Discord official Town Hall server for event happening on February 7th, 2023. Discordas Commitment to a Safer Space At Discord, we are deeply committed to helping communities thrive on our platform. Our teams are always working to make Discord an even more accessible welcoming place to hang out online with your friends build your community. Here are a couple of safety highlights from last year: AutoMod: Making Your Communities Safer Has Never Been Easier In June, we debuted our new automated moderation tool, AutoMod, for community owners admins looking for an easier way to keep communities conversations welcoming to empower them to better handle bad actors who distribute malicious language, harmful scams links, spam. Today, AutoMod is hard at work in over 390,000 servers, reducing workload for thousands of community moderators everywhere. So far, weave removed over 20 million unwanted messages a thatas 20 million less actions keeping moderators away from actually enjoying participating in servers they tend to. Check out our AutoMod blog post if youare interested in getting AutoMod up running in your community. Great Spam Removal Spam is a problem on Discord, we treat this issue with same level as any other problem that impacts your ability to talk hang out on Discord. Thatas why this year, weave increased amount of time resources into refining our policies operational procedures to more efficiently accurately target bad actors.

More Safety Resources Wanna learn more about online safety? How you can keep yourself others safer online? Weave gathered these resources to help give you a head start: Making your hangouts on Discord more private secure Weare excited to announce that starting today, weare rolling out passwordless login with biometric passkeys to streamline safeguard your sign-in experience as well as default end-to-end encryption for audio video (E2EE A/V) calls. Read on to see how these two features will help make your time on Discord safer, for both you your friends on call! Passwordless Login Passwords are annoying to remember are not most secure (yes, that includes awumpu2-1s-c00la). We provide various forms of multi-factor authentication (MFA) to protect your account, but we wanted to continue to prioritize security with a more seamless experience. Now, you can register a passkey to your Discord account, secured by on-device biometric features such as Face ID Touch ID, to sign in with just one easy step. Discord canat access your biometric data, helps ensure that nobody but you can use your passkey to sign into your account.

Passwordless login with a passkey keeps your account as protected as possible. You can learn more about setting up a biometric passkey how to then log in with that passkey here. End-to-End Encryption for Audio & Video (E2EE A/V) Last summer we began experimenting with encryption protocols technologies for audio video calls, we are excited to announce roll out of our E2EE A/V protocol. Today, weall start automatically migrating audio video calls in DMs, Group DMs, voice channels, Go Live streams to a new system that utilizes E2EE A/V. Youall also be able to verify your end-to-end encrypted call identity of other members in it, giving you peace of mind no one else can listen in. When we consider adding new privacy features like E2EE A/V, we do not do so in isolation from safety. That is why safety is integrated across our product policies, why messages on Discord are unencrypted. Messages will still be subject to our content moderation approach, allowing us to continue offering additional safety protections.A Privacy is an essential part of feeling secure, we want to be transparent about security technology we use. Thatas why weave also published a technical blog to provide more insight into work, how we got here, our design implementation goals, technical overview of how we built our E2EE A/V protocol. You can also see how weave worked closely with external experts to assess risks develop robust safeguards to build our protocol. Discord is a place where you can be authentic should feel safe when talking with your friends - this includes maintaining account security protecting your privacy. Passwordless login makes sure no baddies can worm their way into your Discord account, end-to-end encryption has arrived to help keep audio video calls between you your friends private.

E2EE A/V is on by default for up-to-date Discord clients on desktop mobile, support for other clients such as web consoles will roll out next year. You can head here to learn how to verify your E2EE A/V calls are truly end-to-end encrypted.A Obsessed with security privacy? So are we aweall continue to prioritize build products that respect both. Navigating Online Boundaries With Your Teen Weare committed to making Discord a safe place for teens to hang out with their friends online. While theyare doing their thing weare doing our part to keep them safe, sometimes itas hard for parents to know whatas actually going on in their teensa online lives. Teens navigate online world with a level of expertise that is often underestimated by adults in their lives. For parents, it may be a hard lesson to fathomathat their teens know best. But why wouldnat they? Every teen is their own leading expert in their life experiences (as we all are!). But growing up online, this generation is particularly adept at what it means to make new friends, find community, express their authentic selves, test boundariesaall online. But that doesnat mean teens donat need adultsa help when it comes to setting healthy digital boundaries. it doesnat mean parents canat be a guide for cultivating safe, age-appropriate spaces. Itas about finding right balance between giving teens agency while creating right moments to check in with them. One of best ways to do that is to encourage more regular, open honest conversations with your teen about staying safe online. Here at Discord, weave developed tools to help that process, like our Family Center: an opt-in program that makes it easy for parents guardians to be informed about their teenas Discord activity while respecting their autonomy. Here are a few more ways to kick off online safety discussions. If a teen feels like they could get in trouble for something, they wonat be honest with you. So go into these conversations from a place of curiosity first, rather than judgment. Here are a few conversation-starters: Teens will be less likely to share if they feel like parents just donat get it, so asking open questions like these will foster more conversation. Questions rooted in blame can also backfire: teen may not be as forthcoming because they feel like adult is already gearing up to punish them. Read more helpful prompts for talking with your teen about online safety in our Discord Safety Center. Our goal at Discord is to make it a place where teens can talk hang out with their friends in a safe, fun way. Itas a place where teens have power agency, where they get to feel like they own something. Just because your teen is having fun online doesn't mean you have to give up your parental role. Parents trusted adults in a teenas life are here to coach guide them, enabling them to explore themselves find out who they areawhile giving them parameters by which to do so. On Discord, some of those boundaries could include: Using Discordas Family Center feature so you can be more informed involved in your teensa online life without prying. At Discord, weave created several tools to help parents stay informed in touch with their teens online, including this Parentas Guide to Discord Family Center. In spirit of meeting teens where they are, weave also introduced a lighthearted way to spur conversations through a set of digital safety tarot cards. Popular with Gen Z, tarot cards are a fun way for teens to self-reflect find meaning in a world that can feel out of control. messages shown in cards encourage teens to be kind to use their intuition trust their instincts. They remind teens to fire up their empathy, while also reminding them itas OK to block those who bring you down. no, these cards will (unfortunately) not tell you your future! But theyare a fun way to initiate discussions about online safety establish a neutral, welcoming space for your teen to share their concerns. They encourage teens to share real-life experiences stories of online encounters, both positive negative. idea is to get young people talking, parents listening. Sometimes, even as adults, it's easy to get in over your head online. Through our research with parents teens, we found that while 30% of parents said their Gen Zeras emotional mental health had taken a turn for worse in past few years, 55% of Gen Z said it. while some teens acknowledged that being extremely online can contribute to that, more reported that online communications platforms, including social media, play a positive role in their life through providing meaningful community connection. Understanding healthy digital boundaries how they can impact mental wellbeing is important, no matter if youare a teen, parent, any age in-between. When it comes to addressing unique safety needs of each individual, there are resources, such as Crisis Text Line. Trained volunteer Crisis Counselors are available to support anyone in their time of need 24/7. Just text DISCORD to 741741 to receive free confidential mental health support in English Spanish. Our Response to Pentagon Leaks Summary of Current Situation Because investigations are ongoing, we can only share limited details. What we can say is that alleged documents were initially shared in a small, invite-only server on Discord. original server has been deleted, but materials have since appeared in several additional servers. Our Terms of Service expressly prohibit using Discord for illegal criminal purposes. This includes sharing of documents that may be verifiably classified. Unlike overwhelming majority of people who find community on Discord, this group departed from norms, broke our rules, did so in apparent violation of law. Our mission is for Discord to be place to hang out with friends online. With that mission comes a responsibility to make Discord a safe positive place for our users. For example, our policies clearly outline that hate speech, threats violent extremism have no place on our platform. When Discordas Trust Safety team learns of content that violates our rules, we act quickly to remove it. In this instance, we have banned users involved with original distribution of materials, deleted content deemed to be against our Terms, issued warnings to users who continue to share materials in question. Our Approach to Delivering a Positive User Experience This recent incident fundamentally represents a misuse of our platform a violation of our platform rules. Our Terms of Service Community Guidelines provide universal rules for what is acceptable activity content on Discord. When we become aware of violations to our policies, we take action. core of our mission is to give everyone power to find create belonging in their lives. Creating a safe environment on Discord is essential to achieve this, is one of ways we prevent misuse of our platform. Safety is at core of everything we do a primary area of investment as a business: fight against bad actors on communications platforms is unlikely to end soon, our approach to safety is guided by following principles: Underpinning all of this are two important considerations: our overall approach towards content moderation our investments in technology solutions to keep our users safe. Our Approach to Content Moderation We currently employ three levers to moderate user content on Discord, while mindful of user privacy: There is constant innovation taking place within beyond Discord to improve how companies can effectively scale deliver content moderation. In future, our approach will continue to evolve, as we are constantly finding new ways to do better for our users. Our Technology Solutions We believe that in long term, machine learning will be an essential component of safety solutions. In 2021, we acquired Sentropy, a leader in AI-powered moderation systems, to advance our work in this domain. We will continue to balance technology with judgment contextual assessment of highly trained employees, as well as continuing to maintain our strong stance on user privacy. Here is an overview of some of our key investments in technology: Our Partnerships In field of online safety, we are inspired by spirit of cooperation across companies civil society groups. We are proud to engage learn from a wide range of companies organizations including: This cooperation extends to our work with law enforcement agencies. When appropriate, Discord complies with information requests from law enforcement agencies while respecting privacy rights of our users. Discord also may disclose information to authorities in emergency situations when we possess a good faith belief that there is imminent risk of serious physical injury death.

Our Response to Tragedy in Buffalo Our Work With Lantern, First Child Safety Cross-Platform Signal Sharing Program Some of most recognizable names in tech such as Snap, Google, Twitch, Meta, Discord unveiled Lantern, a pioneering initiative aimed at thwarting child predators who exploit platform vulnerabilities to elude detection. This vital project marks a significant stride forward in safeguarding children who on average spend up to nine hours a day online. It underscores a critical truth: protecting our children in digital realm is a shared responsibility, necessitating a unified front from both tech behemoths emerging players. digital landscape must be inherently safe, embedding privacy security at its core, not merely as an afterthought. This philosophy propelled my journey to Discord, catalyzed by a profound personal reckoning. In 2017, harrowing discussions about children's online experiences triggered a series of panic attacks for me, leading to a restless quest for solutions. This path culminated, with a gentle nudge from my wife, in creation of a company that used AI to detect online abuse make internet safer for everyone, which was later acquired by Discord. This mission has been remains personal for me! Discord, now an eight-year-old messaging service with mobile, web, stand-alone apps over 150 million monthly users, transcends being just a platform. It's a sanctuary, a space where communities, from gamers to study groups, notably LGBTQ+ teens, find belonging safety. Our ethos is distinct: we don't sell user data clutter experiences with ads. Discord isnat place you go to get famous attract followers. We align our interests squarely with our users, fostering a safe authentic environment. However, our non-social media identity doesn't preclude collaboration with social media companies in safeguarding online spaces. Just as physical venues like airports, stadiums hospitals require tailored security measures, so too do digital platforms need safety solutions that meet their unique architecture. With all different ways that kids experience life online, a one-size-fits-all approach simply wonat work. This is not a solitary endeavor but a collective, industry-wide mandate. Innovating in safety is as crucial as in product features, requiring open-source sharing of advancements knowledge. For example, our team at Discord has independently developed new technologies to better detect child sexual abuse material (CSAM), have chosen to make them open-source so that other platforms can use this technology without paying a penny. tech industry must confront head-on most severe threats online, including sexual exploitation illegal content sharing. Parents rightfully expect digital products used by their children to embody these safety principles. Lantern is a pivotal advancement in this ongoing mission. Yet, as technology evolves, introducing AI, VR, other innovations, safety landscape continually shifts, presenting new challenges that no single entity can tackle alone. millions tech sector invests must be used to ensure users on our platforms are actually safe, not to persuade Washington that theyare safe. Our industry can lead by sharing with each other working collaboratively with legislators, advocacy groups, academics. Collaboration is keyaamong tech companies, legislators, advocacy groups, academicsa to ensure a universally safe online experience for our children. essence of online safety lies in an unprecedented collaborative effort globally. launch of Lantern is not just a step but a leap forward, signaling a new era of shared responsibility action in digital world. Itas time for us to focus on a safer tomorrow! Parents & Educators, Join Us on Discord!

If we want to do this right, we need to ensure peopleas voices are heard, especially those of our younger users. We have to engage with youth directly to hear their firsthand experiences perspectives on how to shape features to meet their needs. Thatas why weare working closely with organizations teens from around world to develop an aspirational charter that helps us understand how they want to feel on Discord, while informing ways we build new products features to keep them safe on platform. A charter for a better place to hang out Weare consulting clinical researchers at Digital Wellness Lab NoFiltras Youth Innovation Council, engaging our own global focus groups to not only better understand how teens want to feel on Discord, but also what it takes to ensure they feel that way. Based on our findings, weall then partner with teens to co-create a charter that outlines rights teens have online best-case scenarios for authentically expressing themselves hanging out with friends in digital spaces. While our Community Guidelines explain what isnat allowed on Discord, these new principles will ultimately guide users to take on a shared responsibility in creating a fun comfortable space to talk hang out with their friends. What weave learned so far Recent focus groups have shown us that teens navigate privacy, safety, authenticity in nuanced sophisticated ways a they expect online platforms to do same. While our research is only getting started, our teen participants have already emphasized importance of both transparency respect on platforms in order to feel safe to be authentically themselves.aWithout privacy, potential for trust is compromised, preventing free exchange of ideas hindering development of a vibrant supportive online community.a - NoFiltras Youth Innovation Council Member, 14 In spirit of trust transparency that teens yearn for, weall continue to share our processes of developing this charter openly on our Safety Center. Added layers of protection with Teen Safety Assist Along with our work on charter, weare also partnering with technology non-profit Thorn to build a set of product features to protect empower teens.

Weall have other product updates partnership announcements to come! Supreme Court Decision Reaffirms Discordas Right to Keep Your Online Spaces Safe Terms of Service Feedback Changes Context What changed? On October 16th, 2018, we added an arbitration class action waiver clause. To summarize, this clause states that when thereas a disagreement between Discord you, weall use an alternative dispute resolution process known as arbitration. Why did we change it? current legal landscape in United States is such that class action lawsuits can be abused. This clause was added because we are now operating a game store subscription service for profit. Like many other companies, we are now a target for entities who wish to abuse class action lawsuit. If youad like to learn more about legal landscape, arbitration, potential abuse of class action lawsuits, weave included a handful of links in Resources section at bottom of this post. What does that mean for you? We think that people can disagree on whether not arbitration is good in general whether not class action system is one that is beneficial; we donat think itas completely black white. In fact, weare very interested in how Europe is approaching implementing class action lawsuits, as their approach may mitigate issues that United States faces with them. Because we donat think itas black white, one of things that weave implemented (which some of our competitors do not), is to allow you to opt out of this clause completely. We encourage you to opt out if you wish. You wonat be penalized in any way if you do so. At no point will we ever gate any features take any action on users because theyave opted out of arbitration. Changes following changes will be live sometime before October 20th, 2018. United States Exclusivity As we stated above in aWhy did we change it,a our motivation for this change is because of legal climate in United States. To protect our users outside United States, weave decided to modify this clause so that it only affects users in United States. If you are outside of United States, this clause does not apply to you. This means users outside United States do not need to opt out if they were wanting to. Opt Out Extension Furthermore, every user was (or will be if they havenat logged in yet) notified of changes to our Terms of Service on date they were updated by a blue notification bar at top of Discord client. In hindsight, we should have provided notice of these changes much further in advance, so we apologize for that. That said, much of feedback weave received is that our community was not aware of these changes. To provide more opportunity for those who wish to opt out for those who may have overlooked notification bar, weave extended our opt out period from initial 30 days to 90 days. How do I opt out? Stated in our Terms of Service under DISPUTE RESOLUTION: Your opt out doesnat need any specific template form. It just needs request to opt out it must come from email associated with your Discord account. We want to reiterateaaayou will not be penalized in any way for opting out of arbitration. Again, we encourage you to do so if you wish to. a Wrapping Up Thanks again for your feedbackaaaitas important to us as a company that we hear from our community. We really appreciate that you all care so much to voice your opinions. If you have any further questions, please send an email to privacy@discordapp.com weall be happy to answer! a Resources a Teachable Moments Hidden in Plain Sight Using research to help teens build their 'safety muscle' To do that, Discord works with organizations like Digital Wellness Lab at Boston Childrenas Hospital National PTA to understand needs of one of our largest user bases. aWe are experts in technology, not experts in teenagers. So we need to make sure we are pulling in expert research when we're thinking about what it means to be a safe, healthy ultimately, empowering place for young people,a said Liz Hegarty, Discordas global teen safety policy manager.A A Hegarty her colleagues are guided by research, which is empathetic to teens' lived experiences cautions against being overly paternalistic. For example, Digital Wellness Lab advises parents to resist urge to step in solve every problem for their teen, online off. Instead, they recommend asking probing questions talking through decision-making process. This can clear way to have more conversations about digital boundaries. aThese conversations can help teens build their safety musclea, said Hegarty. We built our Family Center with this idea in mind. Launched in 2023, Family Center is an opt-in tool that enables guardians, trusted adults, teens to alinka their accounts. While it allows parents to know who their teen is connected with, tool does not allow adults to see contents of their teenas conversations with friends. aThe key is to find balance between respecting teen autonomy agency while also giving parents ways to check in with their teensa, said Savannah Badalich, Discordas senior director of policy. aParents trusted adults in a teen's life are here to coach them,a said Badalich, who leads team responsible for key safety areas, such as teen safety mental health. aLet them explore themselves, let them find who they are. But give them parameters in which to do so.a There is a risk that a teen may choose not to talk at all if they feel they are being constantly monitored. This is why it's important to follow research. aLeading experts say that sort of parental surveillance does not always help generate safety create a trustworthy environment for teens to talk to their caregivers,a Hegarty said. Hegarty notes that when building Family Center tool, Discord decided to add an additional layer of support. As a teen connects with their parents, Discord surfaces information for Crisis Text Line (note that this is for users in U.S. only). This is a support line that provides free, 24/7 mental health support via text, WhatsApp, web chat. idea is to provide available resources to teens to encourage them to seek help if they need it. Itas another way we embed subtle lessons throughout experience. Weaving in teachable moments Discordas Teen Safety Assist includes two recently released safety features: one for when a teen receives a direct message (DM) from a user for first time, another that blurs potentially sensitive content in DMs group DMs with friends. When an alert is triggered, teen might see a pop-up that says, Unwanted message? If you donat want to chat with this person, you can block mute them.A They can then click to alearn more,a see a message that prompts aUnwanted message?a, as well as provides a set of tips for handling situation.a a aIt's this idea of educating as opposed to just punishing teenagers when they make mistakes,a said Hegarty. aIn moment, itas important to give teens resources, autonomy, agency, help.a Hegarty points to research about how teens are nervous to block other people. They're worried if person finds out they're blocked, teen is going to look uncool. Meanwhile, if they report, they arenat sure what will happen next. They are anxious about getting somebody in trouble. Research from Thorn, a leading child welfare nonprofit, also suggests that when teens encounter a potentially harmful experience online, they are less likely to seek support offline, such as talking to a trusted adult. So Discord is trying to meet teens where they are. aIt's not a paternalistic approach that protects teens from everything. Being overly restrictive risks them lacking necessary skills to move within world once they turn 18,a said Badalich. aInstead, let's educate them throughout their experience. Let's give them tools to control their experience.a Giving teens opportunities to learn Risk-taking is part of growing up. Itas part of being a teenager. aBecause their brain is still developing, they need options, time education,a said Badalich, whose team is also working to sharpen Discordas enforcement system with teens in mind. When it comes to developing policies rules that govern platform, Badalich her team are rethinking what that looks like, with understanding that teens need extra opportunities to learn. aKeep up, take down, ban have been main levers. we're continuing to explore even more ways to take necessary action,a said Badalich. For example, aWhen you think about someone talking about self-harm, do we really want to penalize them? do we want to figure out some other form of intervention?a To be clear, when it comes to most severe violationsasuch as those involving violent extremism content that sexualizes childrenaDiscord will continue to have a zero-tolerance policy. But when it comes to building out more nuanced, research-driven policies, policy team looks to lessons from restorative justice, a concept that recognizes that people are capable of change. aInstead of just being purely punitive all of time,a said Badalich, aDiscord wants to move in direction of where we are giving people opportunities to change, grow, learn.a Upholding Our Commitment to Safety in 2023 Beyond Product Developments Discordas ground-up approach to safety starts with our product features.

These organizations help us to keep our platform internet safer by supplementing our expertise insights helping us to continue to advance cutting edge safety efforts. As part of our extensive fight against child sexual abuse material (CSAM), we continued to deepen our partnership with Tech Coalition. I joined Tech Coalitionas Board of Directors am excited to help shape organizationas future continue to collaborate with industry leaders to combat online sexual abuse exploitation. One of most exciting parts of our partnership with Tech Coalition this year was launch of Lantern, a first-of-its-kind signal sharing program for companies to enhance strengthen how we detect attempts to sexually exploit abuse children teens online. Discord joined other industry partners like Google, Mega, Meta, Quora, Roblox, Snap, Twitch to share signals about activity we detect that violates our policies utilize signals shared by other companies to surface violating activity on their platforms. We also expanded our partnership with INHOPE, a global network combatting CSAM online. Through this partnership, we are better able to collaborate with hotlines globally working to address this important issue.

An equitable world is a better world. So were continuing to expand opportunities for Black, Hispanic/Latinx, Indigenous communities. Our global efforts focus on three priority areas: education, economic empowerment, criminal justice reform. Because creating meaningful change takes all of us. Education that powers possibility. Were increasing support for minority-serving institutions programs that foster skill building, technology training, career growth. Because with more resources, more is possible. Carving creative solutions. Carving creative solutions. In March 2024, 40 educators graduated from Te Pukenga digital technologies teacher training development program, which serves Maori across Aotearoa New Zealand. program was announced in June 2023 as part of REJIs expansion into New Zealand. Since then, participants have helped more than 2,500 Maori students across 10 schools, including kura kaupapa Maori (Maori immersion) schools. programs goal is to combat systemic tech sector gap that exists within this community. By providing educators with access to technology digital curricula, program inspires students to create digital solutions to real-world challenges. Educators are trained in iOS app development with Swift Playgrounds, app prototyping design, digital media development programming. These educators then take their knowledge to classroom, where they teach their students how to blend what theyve learned with traditional techniques, like sketching Maori axe carving designs with Procreate app improving their kapa haka (Maori performing arts) practice with iMovie, among other applications. Te Pukenga graduate Matua Jeff leads Mahi-a-toi Academy at Rutherford College in Auckland. He focuses on teaching his students traditional Maori culture language through song, dance, art, carving. Matua Jeffs students also use iPad to help them create Maori art. He believes that powerful things happen when you combine rich Maori culture with latest tech. iPad is another medium we can tap into that is moving us into future. It has enhanced what we have already been doing, but has enabled us to elevate outcomes be more innovative in how we get students to tell their stories. In addition to helping students tell their stories, Matua Jeff is also creating a deep sense of belonging. Here with Matua Jeff, we feel like its home, says Troy Kuka. I love being in his classroom, working on projects connected to my culture. UP NEXT Teaching tradition through tech. Teaching tradition through tech. There are more than 460,000 Cherokee Nation citizens in world, but only about 2,000 are fluent Cherokee speakers most are over 70 years old. Our language is very ancient, but it holds keys to future where we want to go, says Deputy Principal Chief Bryan Warner of Cherokee Nation. If you get to that last fluent language speaker that person passes, you can hear a way of life ending. That is something we do not want to see here. To help keep Cherokee language alive, Cherokee Immersion Charter School opened in 2002. Oklahoma school teaches math, music, other subjects to kindergarten through eighth-grade students in their ancestral language. Though many students have parents grandparents who were precluded from speaking Cherokee because of assimilation policies, at Cherokee school, students speak their native language freely proudly. Many of these same students become fluent Cherokee speakers continue their studies at Sequoyah High School, where they focus on science, technology, research, engineering, arts, math (STREAM). They are also encouraged to tell stories about their culture. Dana Cochran, a science teacher at Sequoyah High School, says, Storytelling is an important part of our culture. It helps create context. culturally, as Indigenous people, so much of our knowledge is passed down from generation to generation. Another way Sequoyah students are preserving sharing their language is through podcasting. In after-school classes, they learn how to use GarageBand to produce stories about their culture, interests, other topics. To support both schools, Apple donates iPad Mac devices. Apples Community Education Initiative team hosts onsite trainings to share powerful creative capabilities of these devices, so educators can empower inspire students to share their culture in new innovative ways. If we dont tell our stories, they will be lost forever our culture will be forgotten, says River Koch, a senior at Sequoyah High School. But with these technologies, we can share our Nations story with world keep our Nation going.

Throughout his life, Jerome Warfield has held many roles. Pharmaceutical sales rep. Parole officer. Pastor. But at 57 years old, he never envisioned adding coder to that list until he heard about Detroits Apple Developer Academy. Thats when Pastor Warfield, who was born raised in Detroit, realized he could be a force for change within his community by learning to code. Historically home of automotive engineering, Detroit now has a growing class of entrepreneurs who are pioneering a new future of digital innovation. Developer Academy, which has more than 15 locations around world, brought its program to downtown Detroit its first-ever U.S. location through a partnership with Michigan State University (MSU). academy now reaches nearly 750 participants from Detroit metropolitan area every year, with both short-term long-term programs that teach fundamentals of coding, design, project management, marketing, iOS app development. With its wealth of minority-owned businesses, Detroit area was an obvious choice for a new Developer Academy location. for Pastor Warfield, attending program was a transformative experience. Developer Academy is also committed to helping public high school seniors continue their education by providing them with stipends to attend academy. This program changes trajectory of individuals who now have access to technology, says Pastor Warfield. It opens up a whole new world for those of us who have felt shut out of industry. success of Developer Academy is evident in its students. Pastor Warfield plans to apply what hes learned to help senior citizens formerly incarcerated people. Other alumni have built healthcare cryptocurrency apps. still others have been hired as Developer Academy mentors. All of which shows how learning to code has power to benefit both people communities in significant ways. UP NEXT A digital approach to preserving culture. A digital approach to preserving culture. In Mexico, Apple has been working closely with educational institutions across country to help set up launch iOS Development Labs bringing coding with programming language Swift to students preparing them for careers in Mexicos iOS app economy. Among these institutions is Wixarika School of Higher Secondary Education. Wixaritari are largest Indigenous community in Jalisco, Mexico. As world around them continues to digitize, they have been forced to make tough decisions, including leaving their close-knit community in search of educational economic opportunities in distant cities. To help ensure that Wixaritari gain professional skills they need while also preserving ties to their community, iOS Development Labs at Universidad de Guadalajara (UdeG), along with regional partner Enactus, is helping them learn how to design, create, code their own apps. In April 2023, six students two teachers from Wixarika School were invited to lab at Centro Universitario de Arte, Arquitectura y Diseno (CUAAD) campus of UdeG for coding training to support educational economic opportunities in Wixarika community. There, students teachers learned how to use iPad Mac devices gained foundational coding skills with Swift Playgrounds. After their training, they passed on their knowledge to others in their community. Rafael Cazares, Administrator for UdeG iOS lab, is excited by opportunities that coding has provided students. Now they want to solve all problems through apps, he says. They see a problem know they can make a difference. Its empowered them. UP NEXT Filmmakers propelled by purpose. Filmmakers propelled by purpose. Dr. Tytianna Ringstaff believes creativity is a catalyst for change. As Artistic Director of Black Film Institute at Simmons College of Kentucky, a Historically Black College University (HBCU) in Louisville, she other faculty are providing students with a platform to pursue their passion for filmmaking. Apple has invested $25 million as a founding partner of Propel Center, a first-of-its-kind global innovation learning hub that supports all HBCUs. With a grant from Propel, Simmonss Black Film Institute has created programming that gives its students hands-on experience making films including writing, filming, directing, producing, editing, marketing them. We want to make sure our students are leaving with that passion authenticity opportunity to become a vehicle for social change transformation through their own story their own lens, adds Dr. Ringstaff. Using Mac, iPad, iPhone devices, as well as Final Cut Pro iMovie editing software, students produced filmed documentary series Raising Simmons: Treading Lanes. series pilot tells story of 11 Black jockeys who raced in first Kentucky Derby. To me it was very shocking, says Kristen Gray, a student who worked on film. These first jockeys were formerly enslaved. They were some of Americas very first athletes. That story gets overlooked. By creating these opportunities, Simmons College of Kentucky is ensuring that Black history is elevated that more students like Gray are better positioned to pursue film careers. I plan to continue to write produce my short films, she says. Ive even written a number of short horror films. I feel more confident, not only in writing, but in filming, directing, editing.

As part of pilot, 15 emerging Black photographers from London produced over 4,000 photographs using Apple technology. Their work was featured at Southbank Centre many of them won awards recognition for their art. Southbank Centre partnership has since expanded to include Reframe project. Spanning London, Manchester, Birmingham, Reframe provides 21 secondary schools with creative curricula to help spark a passion for creativity in next generation. Reframe also includes an industry-led residency program that helps 80 Black artists develop their skills in photography, music, filmmaking. Participants are given access to a suite of Apple technology to create their art, including iPhone, MacBook, iMac devices, are also mentored by Apple creative professionals. At programs culmination, they exhibit their work at Southbank Centre, with their program peers, other creatives, members of press public in attendance. If you dont feel like you are part of a creative sector that reflects represents your community, that has a huge impact on confidence, says Brierley. This program is an investment in whole talent pipeline, from school to early career beyond. After program ends, support for artists continues. This includes long-term mentorship connection to a growing alumni network. Ultimately, these efforts make a positive impact not only on artists but on industry as a whole. UP NEXT Higher learning within reach. Higher learning within reach. Dr. Amanda Quintero believes that access to education shouldnt happen by chance. daughter of immigrant parents, Dr. Quintero didnt have access to higher education, expectation was that shed find a job after finishing high school. It wasnt until Dr. Quinteros last semester of her senior year that a substitute teacher encouraged her to apply to university. That chance encounter changed Dr. Quinteros entire trajectory. It was moment she started to believe that she had what it took that she belonged. Today, Dr. Quintero dedicates her career to ensuring that other first-generation college students at Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) have same opportunities she had. She serves as Senior Advisor to President for Inclusive Excellence as Equity Innovation Officer of Global HSI Equity Innovation Hub at California State University, Northridge. Launched in partnership with Apple, Global HSI Equity Innovation Hub is working to transform HSIs nationally to increase student success equip HSI students with skills to enter careers in science, technology, engineering, arts, math (STEAM). In addition to technology grants, Apple is providing experts to help design educational spaces programming, positioning learners for success in college in workforce. goal is to move needle on equipping a largely first-generation student population with educational experiences skills they need to become first-generation professionals in STEAM fields. Global HSI Equity Innovation Hub is making this happen by connecting HSIs to resources, thought leaders, one another, sharing what works to accelerate educational equity, all of which leads to a more inclusive diverse workforce. Global HSI Equity Innovation Hub signifies a shift in paradigm from what students must do to be successful to what HSIs must do to serve students intentionally. It puts onus on leadership to shine an equity lens on their structures, policies, practices. It empowers students, faculty, staff to transform institutions, which Dr. Quintero says is key to an effective equity-centered approach to education. other key is engaging families of first-generation college students, who are often disconnected from campus life. first time my family ever set foot on a college campus was day of my graduation, says Dr. Quintero. I dont want that to be experience of other students. Investing in economic impact. Empowered companies lead to empowered communities. So were championing diverse suppliers industry innovators.

I assumed that a free program at a nonprofit was going to be a fun summer camp where Id learn how to write a good story, that was going to be it, she says. But school taught her far more than good storytelling skills. It provided Arteaga with a supportive community of fellow filmmakers creatives who encouraged her to realize her dreams. Today, Arteaga works as a professional director filmmaker says GFS was instrumental to her success. With locations in New York, Los Angeles, London, GFS gives young creatives from underserved communities training, hands-on experience, professional development to better prepare them for creative fields. Arteaga is among many GFS graduates who have pursued careers in entertainment. About 75 percent of GFS alums go on to pursue media studies in prestigious programs at New York University, University of Southern California, University of California, Los Angeles, among other institutions, says Montea Robinson, former student current CEO of GFS. She attributes programs success to its student-led, hands-on, equity-focused approach. Robinson also says that Apple plays a critical role. generous donations contributions Apple has made have allowed our students to create wherever they are, says Robinson. Having tools of storytelling in your pocket leads to accessibility for everyone. Apples partnership with GFS began in 2020 through Today at Apple Creative Studios, a program that provides underserved youth with access to creative education hands-on experience. Through 14-week multidisciplinary program, GFS students made Shot on iPhone short films other creative projects. In 2021, Apple Music mentored schools Los Angelesbased students on topics ranging from planning their careers to navigating industry. Apples GFS partnership further expanded in 2023 2024 with all three GFS locations receiving a REJI grant as part of Apples Black Unity Collection launch. With Apples support of their Fellows Roster programs, by end of 2023, GFS had matched more than 200 students with industry jobs through their media network. Our goal is to put ourselves out of business, says Robinson. We want to create an industry that is so diverse so well trained that there isnt a need for us in future. UP NEXT Financial advice that pays it forward. Financial advice that pays it forward. For too long, Beatriz Acevedo Mary Hernandez heard stories from people in Hispanic/Latinx communities about keeping their money under a mattress stashed away in a safe in their homes. They did this because U.S. financial system has historically failed to understand serve their needs. Acevedo Hernandez knew they wanted to rectify this wrong by supporting their community in taking control of its finances. So along with Xavier Gutierrez, they founded SUMA Wealth. Latina-led financial technology company, with Chief Operations Officer Hernandez, Chief Executive Officer Acevedo, Chief Strategy Business Development Officer Daniela Corrente, first focused on gaining their communitys trust. Corrente adds: Many institutions think because they put a sign in Spanish, they are going to attract people from Latino community, but thats not what inclusivity means. For its part, SUMA Wealth is both an app website that speaks directly to Hispanic/Latinx communities their financial needs in culturally relevant fun ways. A dinero toolkit offers tips like how to pay off credit cards, while another section of site provides answers to 401 que questions. startup receives support from Apple partner VamosVentures, which funds diverse entrepreneurs with groundbreaking ideas. Just over a year after launching, SUMA reaches more than five million users each month. within three months of starting program, these users go from no savings to an average of $500 in emergency savings. Ultimately, we want SUMA to be that all-in-one financial platform that fully supports our community at building generational wealth, says Acevedo. Criminal justice rooted in reform. Were standing up for whats right by supporting organizations committed to transforming criminal justice system. Changing lives by changing systems. Changing lives by changing systems. Carly Stanley knew that things needed to change. criminal legal system that systemically targeted Aboriginal Torres Strait Islander peoples needed to change. child protection services that separated babies, children, young people from their culture community needed to change. Stanley, who had witnessed these injustices firsthand, believed she could fight for that change. So Stanley her husband, Keenan Mundine, created Australian, Aboriginal communityled nonprofit Deadly Connections, which started in Sydney as an outreach program for Aboriginal young people who were frequently targeted by police. vision of Deadly Connections is to address systemic racial disparities through advocacy various initiatives to continue to dismantle disrupt harmful systems that have caused continue to cause a lot of pain for our community, says Stanley. Her outreach initially consisted of playing sports with kids to help keep them engaged connected. From there, Deadly Connections grew into an advocacy support organization for adults children affected by child protection criminal legal systems. prison experience is detrimental not only for individual, but for whole family community. Thats why everything we do is grounded in culture community. We know culture is a protective factor, says Stanley. Deadly Connections grassroots support includes logistical assistance for families such as ensuring that people can get to their appointments. nonprofit, supported by an Apple grant, helps kids young people stay connected to their culture with one-on-one mentoring, group mentoring, pop-up community events. organization is also addressing systemic issues at policy level, including supporting Raise Age, a national campaign striving to stop Australia from locking up young children sending them to prison. Currently children as young as 10 can be incarcerated in Australia, younger than age set by most other countries. Stanley is advocating for all of these changes so that Aboriginal peoples dont just survive, but thrive. UP NEXT Painting new paths. Painting new paths. In Louisiana, kids as young as 10 can be arrested, prosecuted, incarcerated in juvenile justice system. 95 percent of these children are Black. They are exposed to traumas of incarceration denied educational development opportunities that every child deserves. For Journey Allen, this makes her work as Director of Youth Education at Arts New Orleans for its Young Artist Movement (YAM) Diversion Program that much more important. Its why she works tirelessly to be a source of healing guidance for system-involved youth so they can find a path toward a brighter future. YAM, cofounded by Judge Arthur Hunter Jr. in 2021, acts as an alternative to prosecution for children youth with nonviolent offenses. Apple has partnered with Arts New Orleans, a nonprofit organization that supports arts culture around city, to take a stand against incarceration of children by increasing support for program. YAM is only arts-based diversion program offered through Orleans Parish District Attorneys Office. After completion of program, youths cases are dismissed. Allen has witnessed firsthand how working with young people through arts gives them a second chance, as well as a sense of hope possibility. A lot of kids that come through diversion program have a true desire to do well, she says. Theyre just still searching for that thing that will capture their attention. One such outlet is mural painting, which has quickly become one of youths favorite forms of creative expression. Local businesses, nonprofit organizations, city agencies commission these projects, kids gain real-world experience working with clients. They use iPad devices to film mural-making process have even used digital animation software on iPad to project their mural designs onto city buildings. In addition to broadening their capabilities as artists, YAM helps its participants leverage art to speak to issues directly affecting their communities. YAM program encouraged us to help people shed light on different topics, says Aliyah Pflueger, a YAM student artist who applied to program as a way to help develop her creative abilities. We have a voice through this program to say something. People want to hear what kids have to say whats going on around them. Were telling our story helping our community. UP NEXT Funding front lines of change. Funding front lines of change. Black, Hispanic/Latinx, Indigenous communities continue to be disproportionately harmed by disparities in criminal justice system. Black Americans are incarcerated in state prisons at nearly five times rate of white Americans.

Before becoming an instructor at Miami Dade College, Eduardo Salcedo pursued his passions for education, technology, people as a data scientist information technology student. In 2022, Salcedo found a new way to make an impact. He signed up for a class teaching educators how to lead coding classes. Through a collaboration between Miami Dade College, National Coalition of Certification Centers (NC3), Apple Community Education Initiative, this program provides training to educators who then help turn students into professionals through training, educational programs, certifications. Since 2020, Miami has seen a significant boom in tech jobs, Miami Dade College is preparing its community to fill gaps. Miami Dade College is dedicated to helping its diverse population, many of whom are immigrants, join local global workforce with skills they need to thrive. schools partnership with NC3 is adding individuals like Salcedo to instructor pipeline. Peer-to-peer learning is a cornerstone of two-week NC3 program. With little to no coding experience, each educator obtains certification to train others to teach what they learn. curriculum is built from Apple-developed education materials using Swift coding language makes it simple for teachers without any prior programming knowledge to learn to code, prototype an app, teach others to do same. Teaching instructors is very different from teaching students, says Salcedo. We lead with questions like How do you talk to a student who knows nothing about programming? How do you explain something to someone whos never touched a Mac before? We focus on strategies how to be successful. Salcedo is now a Master Instructor with NC3, facilitating in-person trainings for faculty at other community colleges nonprofits. A remarkable 96 percent of educators who take his class pass their certification testing. One student who found success after attending Salcedos coding course offered at Miami Dade College is Luis Napoles. Just six months after he arrived in United States from Cuba, Napoless app, On Watch, was featured in a program showcase. This achievement marked a major milestone in his new life in U.S. his career ambitions. He is now a full-time, skilled IT professional working in Miami, where he effectively applies concepts he learned in Apple Swift course. But program is about more than just new skills passing grades. NC3 has created a community of educators across nation. Many participants collaborate on program enhancements teaching methods that community is rapidly expanding. Miami Dade College is part of Global Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) Equity Innovation Hub serves as a Regional Equity Innovation Hub, an Apple-supported initiative in partnership with California State University, Northridge. These distinctions robust investment by Apple empower Salcedo Miami Dade College to act as a resource for other HSIs interested in preparing learners to succeed in most sought-after careers in tech economy. In almost two years with NC3, Ive met 40 to 50 instructors who are changing lives in terms of teaching students new skills that they can use in workforce immediately, says Salcedo.

Diagnosed as autistic at a young age, Jordyn Zimmerman was full of thoughts ideas. But she struggled to communicate them until age of 18, when a team of advocates supported her access to iPad communication apps. These tools enabled her to begin to convey her knowledge, express her curiosity, advocate for her needs. Zimmerman often points out that lack of speech does not mean lack of language when she advocates for access to robust communication tools for herself for others who are nonspeaking. Zimmerman earned her bachelors degree in Education Policy from Ohio University, where she worked for a more inclusive college experience for herself others. She also completed a masters degree in Education at Boston College is earning a masters degree in Business Administration. Through her experiences in education, she recognized inequities injustices that existed for people with disabilities decided to expand her advocacy to help others. She began to have conversations about systems structures that cause inequity. Now, through policy work partnerships, she continues to reduce barriers to access. Her efforts led to an appointment as board chair of national nonprofit organization CommunicationFIRST serving on U.S. Presidents Committee for People with Intellectual Disabilities (PCPID). There she collaborates with government agencies to identify barriers opportunities, influence policies, promote initiatives that support inclusion accessibility for people with disabilities. Zimmermans work is centered around accessibility inclusion, which includes access to experiences products that everyone can use learn from. while accessibility is a component of inclusion, alone it isnt enough. To foster true inclusion, you must not only have technological tools they must be supported physically digitally so people with disabilities can navigate their environments with dignity, respect, autonomy, says Zimmerman. As head of product strategy for Nora Project, she codesigns curricula that provide educators learners with tools to help them work through exclusionary practices, a framework for evaluating, researching, collaborating, addressing barriers to belonging. These resources allow learners to generate ideas, collectively define problems around access, identify innovative solutions for design implementation. Educating others gets us thinking as a community allows for more innovative problem-solving, says Zimmerman. In turn, this enables all people to engage fully. As part of Apple Distinguished Educators (ADE) community, a group of pioneering educators who are using Apple technology to transform teaching learning, Zimmerman demonstrates thought leadership among her peers to ensure that they have access to innovative teaching learning strategies for students with disabilities. She has been credited with shifting how ADEs think about accessible technology in classroom. Zimmerman is a powerful presenter shares resources on Apple Education Community, an online professional learning hub for educators who are using Apple technology including curricula that integrate inclusive design principles. Her work gives other educators access to more opportunities to challenge systems that perpetuate exclusion.

Language barriers often become an enduring challenge, especially when seeking job opportunities continuing their education. In Idaho, Onramp programs goal is to build states workforce by developing Idaho educators expanding opportunities for students. This statewide program is a partnership between Apple, Boise State University, Idaho Digital Learning Alliance, College of Western Idaho (CWI). For CWI instructors like Sarah Strickley, helping immigrants refugees develop more English communication skills enables them to feel closer to their communities empowers them to make a difference. For equity to happen, we need to educate leaders that look like world, Strickley says. CWIs English language learner (ELL) English as a second language program offers free English digital skills classes to speakers of other languages. With support from Apples Community Education Initiative team, this program incorporates Everyone Can Create curriculum, an introduction to Develop in Swift, devices to aid digital skills acquisition. Strickley has been teaching ELL for over 10 years, she designed a course within program that teaches English through code vice versa. She works with more than 150 students across 30 countries of origin, with more than 31 languages spoken. Students have varying educational levels experience with technology. Some have never interacted with an iPad before, while some have advanced credentials from their home country. What they have in common is a communication barrier that limits potential job opportunities. Strickley says, goal is a sustainable program that every student is able to touch, no matter where they are on their educational journey. Her approach to teaching both language code reinforces unique strengths skills within every student. Strickley believes that creativity plays a major role in bringing people closer to their community. She incorporates Challenge Based Learning an approach to leveraging technology to solve real-world problems which often becomes first interaction for many of these students with their communities. Theyre actively learning to make connections creatively solve problems, while simultaneously building self-confidence valuable social capital. Immigrants refugees often arrive in Idaho without a network support system, Strickleys efforts with CWI ultimately empower them to find their own voice build their place in a community they now call home. Every one of us is a bundle of knowledge, regardless of our language, accent, background, circumstance, Strickley says. education helps us share that knowledge with each other toward more understanding. For her, technology is an equalizer that helps everyone get on same page.

Rutgers University-Newark has a unique student body, university educators agree that getting this population into college, across commencement stage, requires reaching them while they are still in high school. they believe that one of best catalysts for success is coding. To help bridge gap from high school to college, university leaders created a seven-week camp called (G)eneration Code. Spearheaded by former Vice Chancellor Dr. Sherri Butterfield codeveloped with Prime Factors Learning Lab, camp takes a holistic approach to youth development. Prime Factors is a nonprofit started by Newark native Harvard alumnus Elliot Ikheloa along with his childhood friends Emmanuel Larose Daniel Gadabor. They founded organization to give back to their community, they work with Rutgers-Newark to nurture local high schoolers future ambitions.

They also do hands-on team-building activities like rock climbing art even designing a mural thats displayed on campus. Apple supports program with Mac iPad devices connects students with Apple employees across departments, demonstrating that there are opportunities for them in an advancing tech world. Apple also provides scholarships professional learning opportunities within Community Education Initiative network to offer more advancement in app development Swift training. One Rutgers University-Newark student, Muhammed Fakunmoju, participated in (G)eneration Code as a high school junior. At time, he wasnt sure which college hed choose was hesitant about his future in higher education as an undocumented student. But after connecting with Rutgers-Newark community faculty, he experienced care dedication of schools leadership knew he had found right school. Fakunmoju is now in his second year at Rutgers-Newark on a scholarship interns in Vice Chancellors office. Through a program supported by Rutgers-Newark, university even helped him on his journey to become a citizen. He credits his experience with (G)eneration Code as a turning point in his educational personal journey has returned to program as a junior instructor. Many other (G)eneration Code students are making an impact on Newark community by using Swift Xcode on Mac to build apps that address community issues. One app helps community find access to healthcare, while another addresses local food insecurity by helping people connect with nearby food banks. partnership between Rutgers-Newark, (G)eneration Code, Apple shows impact that inclusive comprehensive student coding programs can have importance of institutional support.

With relatively few young Black women represented in technology sector, Tinsley Bryce recognized need for a program that leveraged technology students already had in hand to teach them a brand-new language that would prepare them for careers in technology. Students participating in Keeping It 100 with Code have no prior development experience, many come from underresourced communities. In five months, they move from beginning to advanced levels of coding curriculum based on Apples Everyone Can Code program. An impressive 80 percent of students graduate share their coding projects, with advanced students sharing app designs using Xcode. Apple supports program by providing devices, programming content, mentors from across teams within company. program not only teaches code, but creates a space where young people can collaborate positively with their peers, says Tinsley. Tinsley recalls a student who was more reserved than her peers. During programs graduation ceremony, she revealed that she had a learning disability that prevented her from participating fully. Over course of program, that student gained confidence to use her voice express how she accomplished something she never thought she would: She learned how to code. best part of working with these young women is watching them grow build their confidence, ready to be sent off into world. For me, its best part of my job, says Bryce. Students learn how to solve problems, identify errors in their code, work together to find solutions. These important skills are instilled within students to set them up for success carry them through life. Using coding as a foundation, Tinsley Bryce are working together to improve career outcomes of future generations of Black women girls in technology. Their story represents desired outcome of program itself. When mentorship is activated, in this case between two women in an organization, it can cause a ripple effect that impacts programs that are designed effect those programs have on communities they serve. Working with Miss Seretha is a true blessing honor, says Bryce.

She says that everything used to be done with paper notes, iPad made it easier to learn information skills needed to improve tea production. Many of farmers who enter Mengdingshan Academy have never seen used tablets before; leaders like Wang motivate them to learn because she believes technology is empowering for community. More than 3300 rural cooperative leaders like Wang have received digital skills training at academy. At same time, with support of Apple, CFRD has worked with partners to develop an ecological environment curriculum for rural revitalization. training is designed to promote sustainable development awareness enhance capabilities of leaders of rural cooperative organizations. Cooperative directors are like seeds in communities, taking root, sprouting, Wang echoes her teachers words when considering impact of education. academy incorporates a wide-ranging curriculum from seasonal produce efficiencies supply chain knowledge to marketing ultimately how to better sell products. Farmers entrepreneurs are able to leverage their newfound digital skills to grow even better tea for export thrive in their local economies. Wang continues, Were in age of technology information, its not traditional agricultural era anymore. Training our talents helps us achieve transformation. Before Mengdingshan Academy, many young people in Wangs village left for cities in search of opportunities. Now theyre choosing to stay in their villages because of thriving industry standards, access to innovative technology, more practical training. Wang is thankful that young people are staying, shes hopeful that new talent will arrive in village to help build a more prosperous community together. CFRD is expanding scale of academys best practices to rural areas in more provinces. Apple has also awarded scholarships to 20 outstanding rural cooperative leaders to help them better develop their business encourage a new cohort to learn independently move countryside forward. As cooperative director, Wang studies researches ways to better manage her cooperative unite members. As a result, income for cooperative members has increased their digital skills are continually improving quality of their product. Yaans reputation for tea is growing more more because of these talented individuals. Wang believes, When we are born everyone is same, nobody knows anything.

Since 2017, lab managers professors have taught students how to leverage technology in meaningful ways through Swift coding courses, in 2021 added introductory computer science lessons for youth in their greater community. For Tec professor Apple Distinguished Educator Elvia Rosas, this means inspiring her students with what if? questions asking them to imagine world as they would like to see it. Rosas is one of professors participating in Enactus Community Change Makers program. She began teaching computer science at Tec after working in tech industry for 14 years. Since creating her first software program as a young girl in a small town near Monterrey, Rosas has believed in code as a means of building community creating meaningful change. She encourages her students to really understand that we can make a difference in world. Many students begin her course with no coding experience. Within first five weeks, they begin developing with Swift, creating machine learning algorithms using Apples CreateML framework, developing spatial computing apps for Apple Vision Pro. By end of ten-week course, one cohort collaborated with Tecs School of Medicine Health Sciences to develop custom apps including an app that uses computer vision to help identify where to place stitches around a wound another that uses CoreML models to analyze lung X-ray images. Across Community Change Makers program, hundreds of students participate in hackathons backed by Apple, with challenges set by leading Mexican companies tackling issues like gender equity, health well-being, education, sustainability. Students develop app-based solutions using Swift Xcode present their work to companies with openings for iOS developers. A member of Enactus first woman-focused national hackathons winning team, Gaby Sanchez, used her experience to further a career in software engineering. Ever since winning, I havent stopped. Ive been to five hackathons. Its beautiful to see so many people, especially women, that have same passion as you. Sanchez, a student at Centro de Ensenanza Tecnica y Superior University of Tijuana, continues to stay in touch with other hackathon participants to collaborate workshop ideas. Mexicos representation within Enactus global programming continues to grow. When Executive Director Jesus Esparza joined Enactus in 2009, Mexico was smallest member. Now country represents almost 50 percent of its active projects is proud to have supported universities with 15 winners in 2024 Apple Swift Student Challenge. Esparza champions programs global platform as much as its local impact: We are building a global community. Not just with ideas, but with actions. UP NEXT Blending code, culture, creativity. Blending code, culture, creativity. Blending code, culture, creativity. Santa Fe, New Mexico, is known for its historic architecture, vibrant arts scene, distinctive Indigenous, Spanish, Mexican cultural heritage. Its also home to a burgeoning tech industry. But many local Indigenous Hispanic/Latinx youth do not have equal access to these tech opportunities. Santa Fe Community College set out to bridge gap, launching Santa Fe Creative Coding Initiative to expand offerings in digital creativity coding to learners educators throughout city. With support from Apples Community Education Initiative, this partnership brings a unified coding curriculum to Santa Fe Public Schools, Santa Fe Indian School, Boys & Girls Club Santa Fe/Del Norte, STEM Santa Fe. Students educators learn in classrooms, at conferences, in newly opened tech labs, on college campus. For Santa Fe Indian School (SFIS), becoming a partner meant outfitting its computer science labs with iPad MacBook devices provided by Apple reinvigorating department led by instructor Kate Sallah. Originally founded by federal government as a tool to assimilate Indigenous children, school now educates children from tribes across Southwest in a manner that supports preserves their culture traditions. In addition to courses on Native languages land preservation, computer science program, in partnership with Santa Fe Creative Coding Initiative, incorporates digital creativity coding into its curricula. Students take on projects centered in their own tribal identities learn skills to share with their local community. Sallah encourages students to code what theyre interested in, they also learn to pair their Apple devices with programmable electronic platforms like Arduinos other hardware. Many of her students take inspiration from Santa Fes dynamic art culture. One group of middle schoolers is building a laser guitar modeled after an installation at Santa Fe location of immersive art experience Meow Wolf. Students at STEM Santa Fe are mentoring another group creating an app in Swift on iPad. Other projects are inspired by Indigenous Latinx artwork. Santa Fe Creative Coding Initiative has produced a ripple effect as students build connections from school to school within their community. Sallahs daughter Ruby, a junior at Santa Fe High School, is a peer instructor guiding SFIS middle schoolers through Everyone Can Create projects at STEM Santa Fe STEM Pathways for Girls workshop. Her peer leadership is just one example of how program is inspiring young Santa Fe residents. Ruby is also a peer mentor for middle high school students taking Sallahs computer science classes. This program can open up so many different opportunities, says younger Sallah. its just so important in future careers. UP NEXT Code that reaches new campuses. Code that reaches new campuses. Code that reaches new campuses. Since launching HBCU C2 program in 2019, Dr. Robbie Melton, Tennessee State Universitys associate vice president for National SMART Global Technology Innovation Strategies interim vice president for academic affairs, has guided program into uncharted territories. In 2022, HBCU C2 expanded beyond United States into Africa, serving high school college students attending two-year four-year colleges in Monrovia South Africa. program has been so successful in those countries that Ghana also requested programming. In partnership with HBCU African Education Coalition (HAEC), program offers its TSU-accredited Apple coding course Apple Teacher certification training through its new SMART Center located at St. Martin de Porres School in Ghana. course was made possible by HBCU C2, an initiative by Tennessee State University in partnership with Apple to empower Historically Black Colleges Universities (HBCUs) to bring coding creativity opportunities to their home campuses surrounding communities. HBCU C2 promotes innovation education equity, it aims to address community challenges using app design Apples Swift programming language. Apple helped launch program is involved at various levels, from providing grants technology needed to scale initiative to designing curriculum course content. Apple team has also helped prepare instructors to teach classes using Apple Teacher Training curriculum. In addition to programs in Ghana, Monrovia, South Africa, program has spread to 46 HBCUs, all of which have committed to serving as a Center of Innovation in their communities. Part of this commitment includes establishing an Innovation Team to implement program locally, devising at least two courses each academic year with C2 strategies, offering out-of-school coding creativity learning experiences for all age groups, including through K12 schools, after-school programs, local community organizations. This shared commitment has been instrumental in creating opportunities that are diversifying tech creative workforce bridging digital divide among underrepresented minority groups. This expanded footprint in Africa marks a futuristic step toward our commitment to global education fostering international partnerships, says Dr. Melton. UP NEXT Creating access opportunity for Hispanic/Latinx students. Creating access opportunity for Hispanic/Latinx students. Creating access opportunity for Hispanic/Latinx students. For most of Amanda Quinteros childhood, going to college wasnt an option. As daughter of immigrant parents who werent familiar with higher education, expectation was that shed find a job once she finished high school. It wasnt until last semester of her senior year that a substitute teacher first encouraged her to apply to a university. That chance encounter changed her entire trajectory. It was moment she began to believe she had what it took that she belonged. Today, Dr. Quintero dedicates her career to ensuring that other first-generation college students have same opportunities she had. A leading content expert on Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) recognized student success innovator, Dr. Quintero currently serves as Senior Advisor to President for Inclusive Excellence as Equity Innovation Officer of Global HSI Equity Innovation Hub at California State University, Northridge (CSUN). CSUN hub, launched in partnership with Apple Racial Equity Justice Initiative (REJI), makes a significant impact on first-generation college students throughout nation, connecting diverse talent to opportunity. With Dr. Quinteros visionary leadership, this initiative transforms HSIs nationally to increase student success equip HSI students with skills for careers in science, technology, engineering, arts, math (STEAM) starting with Miami Dade College (MDC) as first regional hub. As such, MDC will work to advance equitable outcomes in STEAM educational pathways, workforce preparation, transition opportunities to STEAM professions, share evidence-based practices, elevate an HSI Community of Practice. Santa Fe Community College Rutgers University-Newark act as program collaborators, with offerings that are part of a national portfolio of innovative practices serving marginalized groups. ongoing goal is to move needle on equipping a largely first-generation student population with educational experiences skills they will need to become first-generation professionals in STEAM fields. Global HSI Equity Innovation Hub does this by connecting HSIs to resources, thought leaders, one another, sharing what works to accelerate educational equity, contributing to a more inclusive diverse future workforce. Diverse talent is an asset that benefits us all, says Dr. Quintero. Its a full circle of giving back, investing their talent with very communities that many of students come from to disrupt intergenerational inequity. Global HSI Equity Innovation Hub signifies a shift in paradigm from what students must do to be successful to what HSIs must do to serve students intentionally. It puts responsibility on leadership to focus an equity lens on their structures, policies, practices. It empowers students, faculty, staff to transform institutions, which Dr. Quintero says is key to an effective equity-centered approach to education. other imperative of programming is to engage families of first-generation college students, who are often disconnected from campus life. first time my family ever stepped foot on a college campus was day of my graduation, she says, I dont want that to be experience of other students. Whole-family programming outreach to students their families will ensure that access to higher education completion of a degree doesnt happen by chance. UP NEXT Learning First Nations cultures histories. Learning First Nations cultures histories. Learning First Nations cultures histories. First Nations history was, until recently, virtually absent from curricula in Canada. historic ongoing regulations of 1876 Indian Act which attempted to assimilate a vast, varied population of First Nations people into nonFirst Nations society impact of residential schools that had suppressed 150,000 children from expressing their culture for generations were often overlooked. last Canadian residential school closed in 1997, further fueling movement toward teaching more First Nations culture history today. In 2015 Assembly of First Nations (AFN) gathered First Nations education leaders across Canada from coast to coast to coast. AFN showcased a collection of artifacts, residential school maps, other materials to help educators teach Canadian history through a First Nations lens. Demand for this collection was overwhelming. Apple was inspired to create a partnership with AFN to increase educational access for Indigenous non-Indigenous students. AFNs Director of Languages Learning a member of Rama First Nations, Renee St. Germain says, Teachers students struggle for reliable resources around culture history. Shes part of ongoing project with Apple to make available digital resources related to First Nations history. result is a downloadable resource providing hands-on educational tools on First Nations rights, culture, history. free Its Our Time: AFN Educational Toolkit includes a growing collection of interactive Apple Books that support Indigenous non-Indigenous educators in embedding new perspectives into their classrooms fostering a spirit of cooperation, understanding, action. Apple has helped AFN develop 15 Apple Books in English in French. Today combined efforts of Apple Distinguished Educators, Apples Community Education Initiative, pedagogical experts, Indigenous education leaders, advocacy organizations continue to empower educators in teaching First Nations history. St. Germain believes, Theres no bad time to start conversation for all people, regardless of age. Teachers are finally able to integrate First Nations into curricula effectively spark more dialogue around this sensitive history. Equity is at forefront of everything AFN does, she says, toolkit is First Nationsled. She emphasizes importance for First Nations students to see themselves accurately represented. There are First Nations students in almost every classroom. Systemic change is growing across Canada, toolkit is building more momentum to make education more equitable for First Nations students future generations. St. Germain now works on partnerships with school boards to expand toolkits reach. Because First Nations people are diverse, Apple AFN continue to work with First Nations education leaders to develop region-specific editions of toolkit to better reflect their respective traditions, languages, cultures. According to St. Germain, theres more work to be done for First Nations people from housing to equal rights to cultural safety for students teachers. Education is part of process. As she says, If we cant find equity in education, where else can we find it? Our work in education doesnt end here. Striving for a world where all girls can learn choose their future. Apple has partnered with Malala Fund since 2018, when we became organizations first Laureate partner to help scale its work for girls education.

If youare getting unsolicited messages friend requests, this article explains how to change your settings. Spam Discord uses a proactive spam filter to protect experience of our users health of platform. Sending spam is against our Terms of Service Community Guidelines. We may take action against any account, bot, server using tactics described below similar behavior. Receiving unsolicited messages ads is a bad experience for users. These are some examples of DM spam for both users bots: Join 4 Join is process of advertising for others to join your server with promise to join their server in return. This might seem like a quick fun way to introduce people to your server to join new communities, but thereas a thin line between Join 4 Join spam. Even if these invitations are not unsolicited, they might be flagged by our spam filter. Sending a large number of messages in a short period of time creates a strain on our service. That may result in action being taken on your account. While we do want you to find new communities friends on Discord, we will enforce rate limits against spammers who might take advantage of this through bulk joins bulk requests. Joining a lot of servers simultaneously sending a large number of friend requests might be considered spam. In order to shut down spambots, we take action against accounts that join servers too frequently, send out too many friend requests at one time. majority of Discord users will never encounter our proactive spam filter, but if, for example, you send a friend request in just a few minutes to everyone you see in a thousand-person server, we may take action on your account. Instead of joining too many servers at once, we recommend using Server Discovery to find active public communities on topics youare passionate about. Servers dedicated to mass copy-paste messaging, encouraging DM advertising, are considered dedicated spam servers. Many servers have popular bots which reward active messaging. We donat consider these to be spambots, but spam messages to generate these bot prompts is considered abuse of our API, may result in our taking action on server and/or users who participate in mass messaging. Besides cheating those systems, sending a large number of messages in a short period of time harms platform. Invite reward servers are servers that promise some form of perk, often financial, for inviting getting other users to join said server. A We strongly discourage this activity, as it often results in spamming users with unsolicited messages. If it leads to spam another form of abuse, we may take action including removing users server. If a bot contacts you to be added to your server, asks you to click on a suspicious link, please report it to our Trust & Safety team for investigation. We donat create bots to offer you free products. This is a scam. If you receive a DM from a bot offering you something, asking you to click on a link, report it. We understand allure of free stuff. But weare sorry to say these bots are not real. Do not add them to your server in hopes of receiving something in return as they likely will compromise your server. If anything gets deleted, we have no way of restoring what was lost. Using a user token in any application (known as a Selfbot), any automation of your account, may result in account suspension termination. Our automated system will flag bots it suspects are being used for spam any other suspicious activity. bot, as well as bot owneras account, may be disabled as a result of our investigation.

Anyone that opens channel will be greeted with a notification letting them know that it might contain age-restricted material asking them to confirm that they are over 18. Any content that cannot be placed in an age-gated channel, such as avatars, server banners, invite splashes, cannot contain age-restricted content. Age-restricted content that is not placed in an age-gated channel will be deleted by moderators, user posting that content may be banned from server. Partnered servers on Discord should not have age-restricted content in those servers. It's worth mentioning that while having a dedicated place for your age-restricted content is permitted, there is still some material that isn't appropriate anywhere on Discord. Content that sexualizes minors is never allowed anywhere on Discord. If you're unsure of what is allowed on Discord, check out our Community Guidelines.

Understanding Avoiding Common Scams Social Engineering Social engineering is a manipulation tactic used by bad actors to trick individuals into divulging sensitive personal information. bad actor often poses as a trustworthy entity, offering a seemingly beneficial exchange of information. In its most basic form on our platform, social engineering is manipulating people to give their login credentials to an attacker. Discord Staff Impersonation Sometimes attackers try to impersonate Discord staff to gather information. To use this tactic, they hack into Discord accounts, then convince an accountas friends list that they've aaccidentally reported them.a They encourage them to reach out to ""Discord Employees"" to resolve issue. These impersonators often copy social media profiles onto Discord accounts, produce fake resumes, may even claim their staff badges are hidden for safety reasons. end goal is to trick you into surrendering your account information, paying for their fraudulent services to aundo report,a acquiring your financial assets. Discord Staff will never directly message users on app for support account-related inquiries. If someone claiming to be staff asks for personal information, payment, changes to your login credentials, we recommend that you do not engage further. All Discord users can report policy violations in app by following instructions here. Discord Staff are one of many groups that may be impersonated. Similar actions may occur for other companies as well, so be wary of accounts that may impersonate Support Safety related questions in other companies too. In general, if you need support at any company, it is wise to go official source instead. You can always verify your account standing directly from Discord by going into User Settings > Privacy & Safety > Standing. Learn more about account standing here. Impersonated Discord DMs Attackers may also resort to impersonating official Discord responses through user accounts bots. Typically, these messages include threats to your account standing if you do not comply with their demands. An official Discord DM will never ask for your password account token, will always display a staff badge on profile, as well a system badge which says aOfficial.a a Malware Tricks Malware often finds its way onto a device through downloads of malicious files. These files may appear harmless even enticingalike a game from a friend. But once downloaded run, they can give bad actors access to your login credentials, email addresses, even your entire device. Malicious Links Fake Nitro Giveaways Always exercise caution when clicking on links that will take you off of Discord, even when they appear to come from friends promise rewards like free Nitro. When you click on a link given to you, a pop up will show that you are leaving Discord it will display website you are being redirected to. It is advised to check link to make sure you are going to place that is intended. a Reporting Scams Reporting safety violations is critically important to keeping you broader Discord community safe. All Discord users can report policy violations in app by following instructions here. Stay vigilant informed to protect yourself your digital assets. Scams go against Discordas Community Guidelines, when we see this kind of activity, we take action, which can include banning users, shutting down servers engaging with authorities.

How teens find explore community on Discord Young people find community identity online Online connections are a fixture of modern life. One in three US adults report they are online aalmost constantly,a a similar share of teens say they use social media just as much, according to Surgeon Generalas advisory. Itas probably true that everyone spends too much time on their phones a but that doesnat mean there arenat important things happening there. For young people in particular, online spaces can be great for hanging out with friends, building social circles, forming identity at a key juncture in life. Technology also removes geographical limits placed on friendships allows people to find like-minded peers much more freely. Itas important to have opportunities to connect with people who are into same things, whether those are passions, causes, an identity. Coming together online can help people find community, help buildA genuine connections. On Discord, that may happen in servers focused on a favorite sports team, video game, TV show. Servers can be small intimate, with just your core friend group who might use it for hanging out chatting. They can also be larger spaces for more people to share ideas, organized around identities, including neurodivergence, disabilities, LGBTQ communities; as well as special interests like music, art, tech. For some people, spaces like these offer support social connection that might be hard to come by where they live. aEspecially as an LGBTQ young person, being able to find a space, be it online in person, can literally be life-saving if they come from an unsupportive community,a said Patricia Noel, Discordas mental health policy manager a licensed social worker. aJust being able to find people who accept you, who use your pronouns a all I can say is that it can be a life-saving experience for young people to be able to come on Discord to find community.a More people are talking about mental health Many young people use Discord servers to support each other as they navigate a difficult stage in life. In servers focused on peer support with mental health, members gather to discuss what theyare struggling with build community around helping one another. These spaces created managed by users arenat replacements for mental health professionals, but they offer an accessible reliable space to be heard, Noel said. Young people look to communities of friends for validation support, theyare at an age in life when that has a significant impact on their sense of self. aYoung people are really invested in their mental health. They want to be having these conversations,a Noel said. aThey're so open about what they're experiencing feeling, even way that they support each other is amazing. They're asking right questions, theyare so in tune with one another, theyare such an empathetic group.a In spaces dedicated to discussing mental health, people may feel more free to share things they arenat yet comfortable sharing elsewhere. They can show up in a space thatas designed to offer words of validation affirmation, offer that same kind of support back to others. aThereas a lot of research coming out around benefits of peer support just being able to talk to somebody who's gone through what youare going through, who's just within your same age bracket,a Noel said. aIt ends up being beneficial for person seeking support as well as person who is supporter.a Building positive spaces for online communities experience of hanging out with friends is central to Discord. Servers are all about conversation a text, voice, video a because thatas how people build genuine connections, in real world online. Conversations happen at both server level also one-on-one with smaller groups in Direct Messages, DMs. We think of this in contrast to social media apps that are built for broadcasting likes, driven by algorithms that monopolize usersa attention. When all your time is spent on shallow interactions endless feeds of other people seemingly living their best lives, itas hard to feel better more connected. Often, opposite is true: research published in Journal of Medical Internet Research found that social comparison on digital platforms, where people judge themselves against others they see online, is aa significant risk factor for depression anxiety.a Experiences of quality interactions social support online, on other hand, are related to lower levels of depression anxiety. good news is we know how online communities can bring people together. internet can still provide new solutions to peopleas need for social connection, Discord is committed to fostering safe, healthy, supportive spaces on our platform. aThe internet isnat going anywhere. It's a tool that young people use, it's going to continue to be a part of their lives,a Noel said. aThey want to be part of solutions. They want to be included when it comes to deciding what happens next.a Words Matter 1. Keep it simple. When designing safety alerts, Discord uses plain language, avoids idioms metaphors, keeps sentences words short when possible. This makes alerts easier to understand in moment, without overloading users with information. This can be particularly useful for users who may be in a heightened emotional state, for example, if they just got a notification that they violated Discordas anti-harassment policy they want to report someone else for harassing them. Our design team tries to put themselves in teensa shoes in those moments. To imagine what their emotional state might be at time. simpler we can make options for them, better. We try to make it easier for them to move through flow so they are clear about what's supposed to happen. Simple language is timeless. It isnat trendy metaphorical. it translates better across different languages cultures. Take for example when a teen receives a DM from a user for first time Discord may provide some helpful education about online safety. a 2. Guide, donat reprimand. With features like Discordas Teen Safety Alerts, Discord partnered with a leading child safety non-profit Thorn to design features with teensa online behavior in mind. goal is to empower teens to build their own online safety muscleanot make them feel like they've done something wrong. So Discord builds teachable moments guidance into our products, using language that aims to restore useras sense of control, without shaming them. aWith teens, because they can't opt out of some of these alerts, we want it to feel more like a guideaa guardrail versus a speed bump,a said Passmore, lead product designer for Safety team. aA speed bump is saying, aHey, you're doing something wrong, you need to check yourself.a But we built Teen Safety Alerts to feel more like guidance.a This alert will encourage them to double check if they want to reply, will provide links to block user view more tips for staying safe. goal is to empower teens by providing information that helps them make important decisions to protect themselves. a 3. Show that youare listening can help them regain control. When a teen encounters potentially harmful sensitive content has a run-in with another user who is acting hostile, they, too, may be in an activated emotional state. They may be angry at other person, even at themselves. This is common with cyber-bullying, which researchers say can lead to depression feelings of low self-esteem isolation. Our approach is to meet them in that mindset. This means offering them options reminding them that they have options like blocking a person reporting a message. We create a space to acknowledge what theyare experiencing. Itas also important not to dwell on upsetting incident. Instead, Discord uses language that aims to move teen out of that emotional state into a place of self-awareness. This can help them to calm down feel more in control. A usersa mindset matters to Discord. That is why we try choose our words so carefully to support in best possible way. How do you define troll-y? Defining terms One of main challenges for Platform Policy team is writing rules for content that isnat so clearly defined. Riggio notes that for most severe violations, such as posting illegal material making an imminent threat of physical harm, line between whatas allowed whatas prohibited is bright red. Discord has a strict policy for those types of violations clear processes in place for removing content banning user. But for content where there arenat legal definitions even clear societal ones, like for bullying harassment, line is more gray. Landing on a definition starts with posing a fundamental question, said Riggio: aWhat is problem that weare trying to solve here on Discord?a How team goes about answering that challenge becomes guiding force behind each policy. For bullying harassment, team looks at user experience. We donat want people to experience psychological emotional harm from other users.A aThe spirit of policy is focused on individual community experience building healthy interactions,a Riggio said. Because ultimately, Discord is a place where everyone can find belonging, experiencing these feelings hinder people from doing that. team did a rigorous amount of research including reviewing other platforms reviewing guidance from industry groups, including Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism Tech Coalition, which was formed so companies could share best intelligence resources when it comes to child safety online. They also read academic literature on what it looks like in society. They also brought in subject matter experts from different countries, such as academics who study harassment legal scholars who can offer additional context for how platforms should be thinking about policies enforcement. These experts provided feedback on early drafts of policies. They defined bullying as unwanted behavior purposefully conducted by an individual group of people to cause distress intimidate particular individuals, harassment as abusive behavior towards individuals groups of people that contributes to psychological reputational harm that continues over time. Policies like this one are only as useful if they are enforceable. So team identified two dimensions that must be taken into account when assessing content. First, intent of instigator. These are signals that user server is posting content deliberately is intending to cause harm. Intent isnat always easy to spot, but Riggio said just as in real life, there are signs. For example, a user is directly harassed by someone, there have been multiple instances of harassment in past. aWhat happens in society happens online. What happens in your high school can sometimes happen on Discord,a she said. second, is content targeted? Is it targeting a specific individual by name? Is it targeting a specific individual by group? Here, there could also be dimensions of targeting users groups because of certain protected characteristics, such as race gender, which would then be considered a violation of Discordas Hate Speech policy. How this policy covers trolling term trolling has many dimensions. Itas been used to normalize aedgy behavior,a Riggio said. aTrolling in of itself is a complicated term, because some communities that intend to cause harm downplay their behavior with, aWe're just trolling,aa Riggio said. Trolling on Discord takes on different dimensions. From ""server raids"", when a group of users joins a server at same time to cause chaos, to ""grief trolling"", when someone attempts to make jokes degrades deceased their next of kin, this type of negative behavior is rooted in disruption harassment, is not tolerated on our platform -- no matter how harmless instigators may think it is. aI hate saying asticks stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me,a because words hurt,a said Patricia Noel, Discordas mental health policy manager who is a licensed social worker has a background in youth mental health. She collaborates cross-functionally within Discord with external partners, such as Crisis Text Line, with goal of providing tools resources to teens who may be experiencing mental health challenges. Why education is as important as enforcement Part of enforcement strategy for bullying harassment is to include a series of warnings, with escalating enforcement actions aimed at educating users, namely teens, that certain behaviors are not OK on Discord. a aThis generation is really empathetic. But I also know that there are people who go online just for sake of going online being a troll,a Noel said. aThose might be very same folks who are having problems at home, who are dealing with their own mental health well being issues. They might not immediately recognize that they are doing harm to someone else.a Understanding that young people are going to make mistakes is reflected in how new warning system handles suspensions. For lower harm violations falling under Bullying Harassment policy, Discord will test suspensions rather than permanent bans. idea here is that some teens may need a long pause before coming back to platform, given how much growth development occurs during each year of adolescence. while there will always be a zero-tolerance policy for most serious violations, Discord will focus on remediation, when appropriate, for topics like bullying harassment. This is so teens can have an opportunity to pause, acknowledge that they did something wrong, hopefully change their behavior. challenge is that behavior is so wide-ranging, said Ben Shanken, Discordas Vice President of Product. He pointed to a recent analysis by Discord that looked at reports of bullying in large, discoverable servers. aIf you put these examples on an SAT test asked, aIs this bullying? Many people probably would answer questions incorrectly,a he said, noting how Discordas large teen user base is inclined to atroll-ya behavior. In one example, Shanken shared how teens were trolling each other by deceptively reporting their friends to Discord for supposedly being underage when in fact they were not. Itas trolling. While itas not nice, itas also part of how teens joke around. But, instead of simply banning offender, we build in an opportunity where they can learn from their mistake. aIf we ban a person, they don't know what they did wrong, they likely won't change their behavior,a said Shanken. aGiving them a warning saying, here's what you did wrong, flips script in a more constructive way. At its core, Discord is a place where people can come together to build genuine friendships. Educating users, especially young people, through our warning system is one part of Discordas holistic strategy to cultivate safe spaces where users can make meaningful connections. nature of being a teenager navigating relationships can be tricky. There are going to be situations where you hurt people's feelings. There may be moments where users lose their cool say something really mean even vaguely threatening,a Riggio said. aWe want to build in more of a runway for them to make mistakes online but also learn from them.a Remediation: Why you canat ban your way to a safe platform Discordas remediation philosophy Our approach to remediation is inspired by restorative justice, a concept from criminal justice that prioritizes repairing harm over punishment. Discordas Community Guidelines exist to keep people communities safe, itas important to make sure everyone knows how why to follow them. still, when people break rules, most of time they deserve a chance to correct themselves show that theyave learned. When users break an online platformas rules, they donat always do so intentionally. Consider how many different platforms someone might use in a day, each with their own rules expectations. Discord needs to enforce its own Community Guidelines, while understanding that a user who violates Guidelines might not even know they had broken a rule in first place. aA lot of users have their own aterms of servicea that may be different from ours,a said Jenna Passmore, Discordas senior staff product designer for safety. Admins moderators set rules, norms, expectations for their own servers on top of Discordas Community Guidelines Terms of Service, users may not know when theyare breaching rules of a server platform. aIf there's a mismatch there, itas not a severe violation, we don't want to kick them off platform.a Instead, Discord wants to teach people how to stay in bounds keep themselves, their friends, their communities safe fun for everyone. And, to be clear, when it comes to most severe violationsasuch as those involving violent extremism anything that endangers exploits childrenaDiscord will continue to have a zero-tolerance policy. Putting users in charge of outcomes In most cases, breaking Discordas Community Guidelines triggers a series of events that are aimed at returning user to their community with a better understanding of how they should behave. Education comes first. When Discord spots a violation, it lets a user know what specific thing they did wrong. Theyare prompted to learn more, in plain language, about that rule why it matters. Nobody expects someone to memorize full Community Guidelines Terms of Service, but this is best moment to help them learn what they need to know. Consequences come next. Any penalties we impose are transparent match severity of violation. A first-time, low-level violation, for example, could prompt a warning, removal of offending content, a cooling-off period with temporary restrictions on account activity. When action Discord takes to enforce its Community Guidelines takes proper measure of violation provides users a path back to good standing, users can often return to their community with a greater understanding of rules need to change their own behavior. If users stay on good terms, similar violations in future will play out roughly same way. If they continue to break rules frequently, violations stack up, so do consequences. idea is to provide users an opportunity to learn from their mistakes, change their behavior, therefore stay in communities they know trust on Discord, rather than pushing users who violate Discordas Community Guidelines off platform to other spaces that tolerate encourage bad behavior. aWe want users to feel like they have some agency over what's going to happen next,a Passmore said. aWe want an avenue for folks to see our line of thinking: You violated this policy, this is what we're doing to your account. Learn more about this policy, please don't do this again. If you do it again, here's what's going to happen to your account.a Banning is reserved for most extreme cases, highest-harm violations result in immediate bans. Otherwise, if someone repeatedly demonstrates that they wonat play by rules, consequences become more severe, from losing access to their account for a month, to a year, eventuallyaif they continue to violate Community Guidelinesafor good. Everyone knows where they stand Remediation depends on users who are able to learn change their behavior being able to return to good standing. Discordas account standing meter lets users see how their past activity affects what theyare able to do on platform. standing meter has five levels: good, limited, very limited, at risk, banned. aFor most folks, it will always be agooda,a Passmore said. When itas not, hope is that someone will act more thoughtfully so they can return to that good status stay there. She compared it to road signs that show risk level for wildfires. aIt changes your behavior when youare driving through a national park you see that thereas a moderate fire risk,a she said. Discordas internal policies outline severity of each type of violation, appropriate consequence, how one type of violation compares to others. These policies help ensure that employees who review violations of Discordas Community Guidelines enforce rules fairly consistently. That means when someone breaks rules, employees arenat deciding punishment on an ad hoc basis. Instead, outcome is determined by severity number of violations. aOur goal is to help people act better,a said Ben Shanken, Discordas vice president of product, who oversees teams that work on growth, safety, user experience. aPeople don't always know that they're doing bad things, giving them a warning can help them to improve.a Ultimately, we believe that guiding users toward better behavioraand giving them tools they need to learnaresults in a better experience for everyone. Bringing Policies to Life Discordas policy team invests time resources into understanding dynamics of type of behavior theyare writing policies about. aThe team does a significant amount of research to understand: What is phenomenon? What does this issue look like on other platforms? What does issue look like in society?a said Bri Riggio, senior platform policy manager who oversees this process. policy team reviews scholarly research, data, nonprofit industry guidance, among other resources. They bring in external subject matter experts from around globe, like academics who study online behavior legal scholars who focus on sexual harassment. They also do internal research. They interviewed Discordas Trust & Safety teamathe ones who review content for violationsato see examples of what they consider bullying harassment.A One thing policy team keeps in mind during this stage is how this research pertains to teens. aTeens are at forefront of my researchathinking about how we protect young people who are online making sure they feel safe comfortable using Discord,a said Edith Gonzalez, a platform policy specialist. She added that she looks for research that addresses parents' concerns when it comes to issues such as cyberbullying. At heart of each policy, Riggio her team start by asking question: What is problem that we are trying to solve on Discord? She calls this idea aspirita of policy. aIf we are trying to stop users from feeling psychological emotional harm from other users, if we want them to have a good experience, then we write policy to try drive towards that north star,a she said. aIt can be a guiding force for us, especially when we get escalations edge cases where policy may not be so clear cut.a For example, if Trust & Safety team gets a report of content that was flagged for bullying, but content falls somewhere in a gray area itas not clear if content was intentional, team discusses if taking action under policy is actually going to solve problem not. Another way of putting it: Does it go against spirit of policy? These discussions inform how policy team can sharpen better articulate policies over time. Policy specialists like Gonzalez begin listing all different behaviors that describe issue. For bullying harassment, examples might include: sexual harassment, server raids, sending shock content, mocking a person's death. aOnce I write down all criteria, I expand each behavior,a said Gonzalez. aHow do you define a violent tragedy? How do you define mocking? How do you define unwanted sexual harassment? Slowly, policy starts off as a list, then I keep expanding it.a For this policy, we define bullying as unwanted behavior purposefully conducted by an individual group of people to cause distress intimidate, harassment as abusive behavior towards an individual group of people that contributes to psychological reputational harm that continues over time. Riggio points out significance of sustained behavior. Itas an acknowledgment that context matters. For example, what may be friendly banter joking between individuals could be misconstrued as harassment, not taking into account that friends sometimes joke around with each other. aWe would be potentially over-enforcing policy with users who are just having fun with each other.a Research experience tell us that people donat always know rules, when appropriate, they need an opportunity to learn from their mistakes. Discord built a warning system that helps educate users, especially teens. (Important note: warning system does not apply to illegal more harmful violations, such as violent extremism endangering children. Discord has a zero-tolerance policy against those activities.) aThere's a perception that teens will roll their eyes at a rule, they don't like rules, but reality is, teens really like it when there are clear rules that resonate with them,a said Liz Hegarty, Discordas global teen safety policy manager. Once they learn rule, they might slip up again, so policy team built in several opportunities to educate teens that bullying isnat allowed. These show up in form of a series of time-outs, versus a flat-out ban after a few strikes, as is common on other platforms. aItas teen-centered,a said Hegarty. aIt's this idea of: how can you educate as opposed to just punishing teenagers when they're making mistakes?a This, too, reflects spirit of Bullying Harassment policy, because ultimately, Discord wants to empower people to build meaningful relationships on platform. aThe spirit is intended to get at various behaviors that we know make users feel uncomfortable,a said Riggio. aThatas behavior that impacts feelings of safety culture of a community.a Our Approach to Content Moderation Moderation across Discord All users have ability to report behavior to Discord. User reports are processed by our Safety team for violative behavior so we can take enforcement actions where appropriate. Discord also works hard to proactively identify harmful content conduct so we can remove it therefore expose fewer users to it. We work to prioritize highest harm issues such as child safety violent extremism. We use a variety of techniques technology to identify this behavior, including: In larger communities, we may use automated means to proactively identify harmful content on platform enforce our Terms of Service Community Guidelines.A If we identify a violation, we then determine appropriate intervention based on content conduct take action such as removing content suspending a user account. result of our actions are conveyed to users through our Warning System. Creating a safe teen experience In addition to all measures we've outlined above, we add layers of protection for teen users. Our proactive approach for teens has additional layers of safe keeping because we believe in protecting most vulnerable populations on Discord. For teens, we may monitor content activity associated with teen accounts to identify possible situations of unwanted messages through Teen Safety Assist. For example, if we detect potentially unwanted DM activity directed at a teen account, we may send a safety alert in chat to give teen account information about how they might handle situation. (For messages between adults, we do not proactively scan read content by default.) Together we are building a safer place for everyone to hang out. To stay up to date on our latest policies check out our Policy Hub. Culture of Safety What do we mean by safety? When we talk about protecting users, weare talking about preventing them from anything that could cause harm. That includes things like harassment, hateful conduct, unwanted interactions from others, inappropriate contact, violent abusive imagery, violent extremism, misinformation, spam, fraud, scams, other illegal behavior. Itas a broad set of experiences, but each of them can affect someoneas life negatively in real ways. They also degrade overall experience of community where they happen. In addition to keeping users safe, we also need them to feel safe. Thatas why we talk openly about our work, publish safety metrics each quarter, give everyone access to resources in our Safety Center. A culture of safety starts with people building technology Discordas commitment to safety is reflected in its staff way we build our products. Over 15% of our staff works directly on team that ensures our users have a safe experience. We invest time resources here because keeping users safe is a core responsibility: Itas central to our mission to create best place to hang out online talk to friends. Our safety work includes experts from all parts of company, with a wide range of backgrounds. These experts are engineers, product managers, designers, legal experts, policy experts, more. Some have worked in technology, but also social work, teen media, human rights, international law. Building a diverse team like this helps ensure we get a 360-degree view on threats risks, best ways to protect against them. We also invest in proactively detecting removing harmful content before it is viewed experienced by others. During fourth quarter of 2023, 94% of all servers that were removed were removed proactively. Weave built specialized teams, formed external partnerships with industry experts, integrated advanced technology machine learning to keep us at cutting edge of providing a safe experience for users. Getting users engaged in safety While rules technical capabilities lay foundation, users play a central part in making servers safe for themselves others. Our Community Guidelines clearly communicate what activities arenat allowed on Discord. We warn, restrict, even ban users servers if they violate those rules. But we donat want to spend our days chastising punishing people, we donat want people to worry that theyare always at risk of being reported. Thatas no way to have fun with friends. Instead, we help users understand when theyave done something wrong nudge them to change their behavior. When people internalize rules that way, they recognize when they, someone else, might be breaking them. They discuss rules organically, in process build a shared sense of what keeps their community safe in good standing. This has a multiplier effect on our work to build safer spaces: Users act with greater intention they more proactively moderate themselves their communities against unsafe actions. When communities have this shared commitment to rules, theyare also more likely to report harmful activity that could put an otherwise healthy community at risk. Changing safety narrative Itas sometimes said in technology that a platform canat really reduce harm block bad actors from doing bad things. Instead, those actions have to be addressed after they happen, when theyare reported detected. At Discord, we have loftier goals than that. We actually want to reduce harm. We want to make it so hard for bad actors to use our platform that they donat even try. For everyone else, we want to build products provide guidance that make safety not just a technical accomplishment, but a cultural value throughout our company communities we support. How Do aTeensa Rightsa Show Up in Discordas Enforcement Policies? What is a teensa rights approach? A teensa rights approach honors young peopleas experience, including areas where they could use a little helpasay, when they push boundaries just a little too far succumb to peer pressure engage in inappropriate behavior online. idea comes from United Nationsa guidance on impact of digital technologies on young peopleas lives. For report, committee members consulted with governments, child experts, other human rights organizations to formulate a set of principles designed to aprotect fulfill childrenas rightsa in online spaces. committee also engaged those at center of reportayoung people themselves. UNas guidance was not only rooted in research, it treated teens with respect. It listened to them. It's this kind of holistic human rights approach that makes this body of work so influential, especially for child rights advocates. But itas also become a guiding force for Discord. aTeens are going to try things out, figure out who they are, make mistakes online. Discord is focused on guiding them through that process without being overly punitive cutting them off from their support networks their friends,a said Laney Cloyd, a senior product policy specialist. Cloyd her colleagues set out to construct a new warning system for when a teen breaks Discordas rules. They started with idea that young people are going to do regrettable things, like send their friend a link that says, aFortnite cheats herea aCute kitten picsa itas really an IP grabber. They may think it's funny not harmful, but itas still against rules. aWe can't be super punitive on first violation, because they don't know. We have to teach them,a said Cloyd. Of course, when someone violates rules, there should be consequences. But a teensa rights approach considers a personas potential to changeacall it a teachable moment. Teens need extra opportunities to figure out what boundaries are. Itas true when theyare at home with their parents, when theyare at school with their teachers, when theyare on platforms like Discord with its own set of community guidelines. Parents, teachers, coaches are there to tell young people whatas what. Discord saw an opportunity to play that role online: We built interactive educational moments that explain to a person what they did wrong. aAs opposed to just saying, ayou're kicked off, go read our guidelines,a we offer more guidance so they can do better,a said Liz Hegarty, Discordas global teen policy manager. Hegarty pointed to research that shows teens really aren't given great advice about how to handle themselves online. Platforms have a role to play in helping teens build their digital citizenship skills. All of this is part of Discordas philosophy for designing policies that hangs on belief that people are capable of change if you give them a chance, especially when those people are young still learning. They need a chance at rehabilitation. (An important caveat is that some violations are more serious than others, Discord takes appropriate action depending on severity of violation. For example, we have will continue to have a zero-tolerance policy towards violent extremism content that sexualizes children.) It might sound odd that a tech company would borrow ideas from preeminent human rights organization. But consider most foundational tenet of human rights: right to live freely safely. Platforms like Discord are most successful when they enable people to be themselves, have fun, make meaningful connectionsaall without fear threats to their safety well-being. How do teensa rights actually show up on Discord? To illustrate how teensa rights are woven into our warning system, take for example Discordas updated approach to enforcing our Bullying Harassment policy. First, itas helpful to understand that bullying is broken down into a number of different dimensions. One of those includes imminent threats of physical harmafor example, extortion a death threat. For violations of that severity, there are no second chances. Users donat get to do that on Discord. But for non-imminent non-physical threats, Discord has built in more opportunities for teens to get message that bullying isnat allowed. These show up in form of a series of time-outs. Say a teen has been flagged for harassing a useramaybe theyare degrading mocking someone. For their first violation, they would get a notice Discord would remove content. Then second time, theyall get a notice, content will get removed, teen will be placed in aread onlya mode for a set number of hours. If it keeps happening, Discord will apply longer longer time outs. Ultimately if teen doesnat change their behavior continues to engage in harassment sustained bullying, they can receive a yearas suspension. This approach is in contrast to a traditional athree strikes youare outa rule, where most violations, no matter how severe, would count against you, then after three dings, youare banned for good. Discordas more rehabilitative approach takes into account too-real probability that teens are going to make mistakes. aImagine a 14-year-old who falls in with a bad crowd engages in a bunch of bullying gets suspended for a year,a said Cloyd. aIf they return, a 15 year old is going to be a different person in a lot of fundamental ways.a new warning system is also geared toward addressing specific thing a teen did wrong. For example, letas say a teen posts an image that violates Discordas rules. An appropriate measure would be to turn off their ability to post images for a while, but they can still talk to their friends, join voice chats, play games. aWe're taking very targeted interventions not just slamming a big ban hammer down,a said Cloyd. aBecause you posted one wrong image you didn't know was wrong, wead block you out of app forever? That's not fair. That's not a learning experience.a Why do teens need special rights in digital spaces? aWe intuitively recognize that as children get a little bit older, they are autonomous humans. They have agency,a said Hegarty. aThey have right to access online spaces safely.a This goes back to UN document, which Hegarty first encountered before she came to Discord when she worked for a childrenas digital advocacy organization. aThe whole world is fairly new to thinking about how we handle teens in online spaces, especially when more more of their lives are taking place online. It has an impact across everything from telemedicine to education,a said Hegarty. Teens are at a transformative exciting stage of life. They get to explore world in new ways. They use platforms like Discord to find themselves make meaningful connections, but that can't be separated from potential that they'll make mistakes along way. Recognizing thataand helping them grow from itahelps keep everyone safer. Teachable Moments Hidden in Plain Sight Using research to help teens build their 'safety muscle' To do that, Discord works with organizations like Digital Wellness Lab at Boston Childrenas Hospital National PTA to understand needs of one of our largest user bases. aWe are experts in technology, not experts in teenagers. So we need to make sure we are pulling in expert research when we're thinking about what it means to be a safe, healthy ultimately, empowering place for young people,a said Liz Hegarty, Discordas global teen safety policy manager.A A Hegarty her colleagues are guided by research, which is empathetic to teens' lived experiences cautions against being overly paternalistic. For example, Digital Wellness Lab advises parents to resist urge to step in solve every problem for their teen, online off. Instead, they recommend asking probing questions talking through decision-making process. This can clear way to have more conversations about digital boundaries. aThese conversations can help teens build their safety musclea, said Hegarty. We built our Family Center with this idea in mind. Launched in 2023, Family Center is an opt-in tool that enables guardians, trusted adults, teens to alinka their accounts. While it allows parents to know who their teen is connected with, tool does not allow adults to see contents of their teenas conversations with friends. aThe key is to find balance between respecting teen autonomy agency while also giving parents ways to check in with their teensa, said Savannah Badalich, Discordas senior director of policy. aParents trusted adults in a teen's life are here to coach them,a said Badalich, who leads team responsible for key safety areas, such as teen safety mental health. aLet them explore themselves, let them find who they are. But give them parameters in which to do so.a There is a risk that a teen may choose not to talk at all if they feel they are being constantly monitored. This is why it's important to follow research. aLeading experts say that sort of parental surveillance does not always help generate safety create a trustworthy environment for teens to talk to their caregivers,a Hegarty said. Hegarty notes that when building Family Center tool, Discord decided to add an additional layer of support. As a teen connects with their parents, Discord surfaces information for Crisis Text Line (note that this is for users in U.S. only). This is a support line that provides free, 24/7 mental health support via text, WhatsApp, web chat. idea is to provide available resources to teens to encourage them to seek help if they need it. Itas another way we embed subtle lessons throughout experience. Weaving in teachable moments Discordas Teen Safety Assist includes two recently released safety features: one for when a teen receives a direct message (DM) from a user for first time, another that blurs potentially sensitive content in DMs group DMs with friends. When an alert is triggered, teen might see a pop-up that says, Unwanted message? If you donat want to chat with this person, you can block mute them.A They can then click to alearn more,a see a message that prompts aUnwanted message?a, as well as provides a set of tips for handling situation.a a aIt's this idea of educating as opposed to just punishing teenagers when they make mistakes,a said Hegarty. aIn moment, itas important to give teens resources, autonomy, agency, help.a Hegarty points to research about how teens are nervous to block other people. They're worried if person finds out they're blocked, teen is going to look uncool. Meanwhile, if they report, they arenat sure what will happen next. They are anxious about getting somebody in trouble. Research from Thorn, a leading child welfare nonprofit, also suggests that when teens encounter a potentially harmful experience online, they are less likely to seek support offline, such as talking to a trusted adult. So Discord is trying to meet teens where they are. aIt's not a paternalistic approach that protects teens from everything. Being overly restrictive risks them lacking necessary skills to move within world once they turn 18,a said Badalich. aInstead, let's educate them throughout their experience. Let's give them tools to control their experience.a Giving teens opportunities to learn Risk-taking is part of growing up. Itas part of being a teenager. aBecause their brain is still developing, they need options, time education,a said Badalich, whose team is also working to sharpen Discordas enforcement system with teens in mind. When it comes to developing policies rules that govern platform, Badalich her team are rethinking what that looks like, with understanding that teens need extra opportunities to learn. aKeep up, take down, ban have been main levers. we're continuing to explore even more ways to take necessary action,a said Badalich. For example, aWhen you think about someone talking about self-harm, do we really want to penalize them? do we want to figure out some other form of intervention?a To be clear, when it comes to most severe violationsasuch as those involving violent extremism content that sexualizes childrenaDiscord will continue to have a zero-tolerance policy. But when it comes to building out more nuanced, research-driven policies, policy team looks to lessons from restorative justice, a concept that recognizes that people are capable of change. aInstead of just being purely punitive all of time,a said Badalich, aDiscord wants to move in direction of where we are giving people opportunities to change, grow, learn.a Building a Safer Place for Teens to Hang Out Choose what you see who you want to hang with Introducing our new Teen Safety Assist initiative: Teen Safety Assist is focused on further protecting teens by introducing a new series of features, including multiple safety alerts sensitive content filters that will be default enabled for teen users. Starting next week, weare excited to release first two features of Teen Safety Assist initiative. Teens have shared that they like tools that help them avoid unwanted direct messages (DMs) media. To support this, weare rolling out safety alerts on senders sensitive content filters that automatically blur media that may be sensitive a even if sender doesnat initially blur it with a spoiler tag.A a Weave partnered with technology non-profit Thorn to design these features together based on their guidance on teen online safety behaviors what works best to help protect teens. Our partnership has focused on empowering teens to take control over safety how best to guide teens to helpful tips resources. Weare grateful for support of Thorn to ensure we build right protections empower teens with tools resources they need to have a safer online experience. first two features of Teen Safety initiative will start rolling out globally in November 2023 will be turned on by default for teen users. Stay tuned for many more features from this initiative as we look ahead to next year. Work together to keep each other safe We know mistakes happen rules are accidentally broken. Our new Warning System includes multiple touchpoints so users can easily understand rule violations consequences. These touchpoints provide more transparency into Discord interventions, letting users know how their violation may impact their overall account standing gives information for them to do better in future. We built this system so users can learn how to do better in future help keep all hangouts safe.A Some violations are more serious than others, weall take appropriate action depending on severity of violation. For example, we have will continue to have a zero-tolerance policy towards violent extremism content that sexualizes children. Warning System is built based on our teen-centric policies. This is a multi-year, focused effort to invest more deeply holistically into our teen safety efforts. We incorporate teen-centric philosophies in how we enforce our policies, assess risks of new products with Safety by Design, communicate our policies in an age-appropriate manner. For Warning System, this means that we consider how teens are growing, learning, taking age-appropriate risks as they mature, we give them more opportunities to learn from mistakes rather than punish them harshly. Warning System starts rolling out today in select regions. Stay tuned for many more updates to our Warning System in future. a For our server moderators admins, weave recently expanded their safety toolkit with new features that allow them to proactively identify potentially unsafe activity, such as server raids DM spam, take swift actions as needed.A We began rolling these tools in September to Community Servers, now weare rolling them out to all servers. You choose what stays private While you might be an open book with your friends, having your personal business out there for everyone to see can feel a bit weird. Thatas why you get to decide, from server to server, how much you want to share how easy it is to contact you. With Server Profiles, you can adjust to how you present yourself in different spaces, allowing you to be as much of real ayoua as you feel comfortable being in any particular group.A You can also always try turning on Message Requests: a feature that sends any DM from someone new into a separate inbox requires your approval before that user can DM you again. Or, go extra mile turn off DMs entirely from server members unless youave explicitly added them to your friends list. Weave got you PHEW, okaya that was a lot. Thanks for stickina around jamming through our most recent updates with us.

Navigating Online Boundaries With Your Teen Weare committed to making Discord a safe place for teens to hang out with their friends online. While theyare doing their thing weare doing our part to keep them safe, sometimes itas hard for parents to know whatas actually going on in their teensa online lives. Teens navigate online world with a level of expertise that is often underestimated by adults in their lives. For parents, it may be a hard lesson to fathomathat their teens know best. But why wouldnat they? Every teen is their own leading expert in their life experiences (as we all are!). But growing up online, this generation is particularly adept at what it means to make new friends, find community, express their authentic selves, test boundariesaall online. But that doesnat mean teens donat need adultsa help when it comes to setting healthy digital boundaries. it doesnat mean parents canat be a guide for cultivating safe, age-appropriate spaces. Itas about finding right balance between giving teens agency while creating right moments to check in with them. One of best ways to do that is to encourage more regular, open honest conversations with your teen about staying safe online. Here at Discord, weave developed tools to help that process, like our Family Center: an opt-in program that makes it easy for parents guardians to be informed about their teenas Discord activity while respecting their autonomy. Here are a few more ways to kick off online safety discussions. If a teen feels like they could get in trouble for something, they wonat be honest with you. So go into these conversations from a place of curiosity first, rather than judgment. Here are a few conversation-starters: Teens will be less likely to share if they feel like parents just donat get it, so asking open questions like these will foster more conversation. Questions rooted in blame can also backfire: teen may not be as forthcoming because they feel like adult is already gearing up to punish them. Read more helpful prompts for talking with your teen about online safety in our Discord Safety Center. Our goal at Discord is to make it a place where teens can talk hang out with their friends in a safe, fun way. Itas a place where teens have power agency, where they get to feel like they own something. Just because your teen is having fun online doesn't mean you have to give up your parental role. Parents trusted adults in a teenas life are here to coach guide them, enabling them to explore themselves find out who they areawhile giving them parameters by which to do so. On Discord, some of those boundaries could include: Using Discordas Family Center feature so you can be more informed involved in your teensa online life without prying. At Discord, weave created several tools to help parents stay informed in touch with their teens online, including this Parentas Guide to Discord Family Center. In spirit of meeting teens where they are, weave also introduced a lighthearted way to spur conversations through a set of digital safety tarot cards. Popular with Gen Z, tarot cards are a fun way for teens to self-reflect find meaning in a world that can feel out of control. messages shown in cards encourage teens to be kind to use their intuition trust their instincts. They remind teens to fire up their empathy, while also reminding them itas OK to block those who bring you down. no, these cards will (unfortunately) not tell you your future! But theyare a fun way to initiate discussions about online safety establish a neutral, welcoming space for your teen to share their concerns. They encourage teens to share real-life experiences stories of online encounters, both positive negative. idea is to get young people talking, parents listening. Sometimes, even as adults, it's easy to get in over your head online. Through our research with parents teens, we found that while 30% of parents said their Gen Zeras emotional mental health had taken a turn for worse in past few years, 55% of Gen Z said it. while some teens acknowledged that being extremely online can contribute to that, more reported that online communications platforms, including social media, play a positive role in their life through providing meaningful community connection. Understanding healthy digital boundaries how they can impact mental wellbeing is important, no matter if youare a teen, parent, any age in-between. When it comes to addressing unique safety needs of each individual, there are resources, such as Crisis Text Line. Trained volunteer Crisis Counselors are available to support anyone in their time of need 24/7. Just text DISCORD to 741741 to receive free confidential mental health support in English Spanish.

A You can learn more about Discordas partnership with Crisis Text line here. You can find more resources about mental health here. What Happens After I Submit a Report? When we become aware of content that violates our Community Guidelines Terms of Service, our Safety team reviews takes necessary enforcement actions, including: disabling accounts, removing servers, when appropriate, engaging with proper authorities. We may not review your report manually respond to you directly, but weall use your report to improve Discord. You can read more about reports we receive actions we take on violations of our Community Guidelines Terms of Service in our quarterly Transparency Report. a Developing Moderator Guidelines Lead by Example moderators are people that your community members look to, not just for enforcement of server rules maintaining peace, but also as role models for what behavior is appropriate for server. If your users see moderators ignoring bending certain rules, they will learn that that is ok for them to do so also, they will call you out if you attempt to hypocritically enforce rules against them. As such, moderators should hold themselves to a higher standard than other users, especially in regards to civility more subjective rules such as what is considered NSFW content. This also applies also for private interactions among mod team. For example, if a moderator is talking in chat shares a suggestive picture, users will understand that other pictures that are equally as suggestive are ok to post. Not only will this encourage borderline rule-breaking behavior, it makes it more difficult for moderators to peacefully moderate NSFW content because users will say aWell, you posted this picture picture I posted is basically same.a same holds true in way moderators respond to questions. If someone asks for help on something moderators respond to them rudely condescendingly others will treat new users same way create a hostile environment. Thatas not to say that moderators canat have fun, of course. Moderators can should participate in chat regularly engage with members as normal users. If a moderator entering chat is disruptive in of itself, it usually means that moderators are not active enough in server. Ultimately, moderators should strive to be seen fondly by server members, yet respected in their positions of authority. Moderators that fail to enforce rules will be seen as unprofessional apushoversa by server members, while moderators that enforce rules too strictly and/or do not participate in chat will be seen as aloof, aggressive, out of touch. Spirit of Rules One of things you may often hear is that aspirit of rulesa is more important than aletter.a In other words, it is more important that people follow intent of rules, rather than adhering to a literal technical definition. As a result, moderators should focus on managing problems of chat, including addressing unhealthy behavior that may not directly break a rule. It is appropriate to moderate people that are deliberately toeing line to see what they can get away with (i.e., trolling), but what many moderator teams also forget is that rules are not infallible, moderators should use their judgment to enforce rules only when it makes sense, not blindly following letter of law. There may be instances where wording specifics of rules end up disallowing behavior that, in practice, does not go against main principle of moderation. In these cases, moderators should refrain from warning user without consulting rest of their mod team also seriously consider modifying rules to more accurately reflect expectations of mod team in regards to server conduct. For example: letas say you have a rule that prevents users from cropping images to focus on sexual body parts in order to prevent NSFW conversations from occurring in chat. However, someone ends up cropping an image of an in game character to focus on her skirt from behind, discussing outfit. In this case, it may not be appropriate to warn user since they are using this image to start an appropriate conversation, even if it technically breaks rule about cropping pictures. So, mod team should discuss ways that rule can be rewritten to cover scenarios like these, rather than resign themselves to warning user abecause rules say so.a Remember: rules exist to serve community, not other way around. Moderators should conduct themselves in accordance with rules, potentially even better, but they ultimately have power to change them for better of server if need be. Treat your rules as a living document remember that they are there to improve your community, not stunt it. When to Forgo Progressive Discipline While certain rules readily offer an ainstant bana option (such as doxxing) in some cases, a useras conduct may reveal that they are only in chat to troll otherwise cause trouble in a way that does not break one of instant ban rules. Just as rules exist to serve community, so too does progressive discipline system. purpose of progressive discipline system is to allow your members to understand their bad behavior rectify it in future without unduly punishing them for occasional small mistakes. Conversely, this means that users that are clearly acting in bad faith on server may not be afforded same leniency should be muted banned depending on circumstances especially if user in question does not have any previously normal chat history. While users that instantly break rules without message history could all be potentially banned, some behavior you may want to consider in particular includes: Itas important that disruptive users be addressed quickly before they sour mood of other server members (which could lead to additional infractions from users that were incited by original bad behavior in first place). Just as moderators should not use rules to punish users that donat practically deserve it, moderators should also be sure not to allow disruptive users to remain on principle of following policy. Other Considerations While principles above are most generally important moderation principles, there may be other things you want to include in your moderator guidelines channel as well such as Always keep in mind any peculiarities of your server questions your moderators might have so that you can proactively address them before they become issues. Summary A moderation guidelines channel is an important channel for helping your moderators get acquainted with both procedural aspects of moderation more subjective aspects. Moderators should be aware that they are leading by example hold themselves to a higher standard so that other users will be encouraged to follow their example. This will help them perform their duties smoothly as well as allow them to readily de-escalate conflicts before they become an issue, encouraging a positive server culture. Finally, by encouraging your moderators to evaluate situations critically, you have mods that can understand both when users should be swiftly punished as well as when rules may need to be adjusted clarified to allow greater flexibility. If youare interested in seeing example moderation guidelines, you can check out link here. Hopefully these help you in developing your own moderation guidelines. Happy moderating! Using XP Systems What Are XP Systems How Do They Work? One of most important factors of keeping a community alive healthy is activity. To maintain activity, moderators can use a few different methods which generally can be separated into two groups: active passive. Active methods are those which require presence active participation of a moderator. Passive methods, on other hand, do not require a constant presence from an individual are often automated by using bots. Keep in mind that even passive methods will require occasional maintenance from a moderator. One of more popular passive methods are XP systems. XP systems, otherwise known as experience leveling systems, grant users experience points (XP) levels based on their activity in a server. Their main purpose is to reward member activity in community. These systems exist in form of bots. Usually they are just one function of multi-purpose bots, but there are cases where sole function of bot is leveling system. basic way these systems work is: These four steps are only a simplification of process, there are many options to consider while using these systems. Depending on bot you choose to use, you can get various options for configuration but there are several that are commonly available on most bots. Some of these options are: Usage of XP Systems main function of XP systems is to reward user activity. Their ability to passively lead users towards being active allows moderators to occasionally take a moment to step back from their usual activities of engaging with their community. existence of a leaderboard appeals to competitive nature of humans pulls them to be more active. Rewards additionally add to this appeal. This is applicable in small, medium some large communities. Alternatively, XP systems can be used as a measure of security. By locking certain permissions behind levels, you can make sure that inactive malicious users are prevented from committing certain offenses. This is mostly applicable in very large servers. Both of these routes will require utilization of roles. There are two main reasons for this: Regulation of Activity As goal of XP systems is to boost activity, it is important to note that they will also lure in users who believe any type of activity is acceptable. This is not case. While problem of spam is already resolved by cooldown ability of most XP systems, there are still behavioral issues that need to be addressed. Members need to be aware that rules still exist in community they cannot simply do as they please. It is important to moderate those who blatantly misbehave in order to level up. Other contributions to community, which are not measured with activity in text voice chat, should also be rewarded, such as artworks, stories, etc. Furthermore, activity that comes from channels which encourage spam-like behavior, such as bot channels, should not count towards total. For that reason, XP gain should be disabled in channels of that sort. Types of XP Systems Knowing that we have ability to reset XP in server, we can use this option to create different types of XP systems. We can divide XP systems into three different types: cyclical, permanent combined. Cyclical systems reset XP points in a regular cycle. Cycle duration should be set based on activity, though it is not advisable to use this system in communities with very low activity. constant resets in leaderboard allow new members to climb charts quickly, but this only lets system be used for rewards. It is common to give out special rewards to most active users at end of cycle, such as custom roles for duration of following cycle, which encourages continued activity to retain their rewards. This also gives moderators opportunity to post announcements regularly at ends of cycles. biggest downside of this system is that not all bots have ability to also remove leveling roles when cycle ends. Permanent systems do not reset at any point in time. Occasionally, users that are banned have left are removed from leaderboards. They give a good look into who most active dedicated users in community are. Permanent systems can be used both for rewards security. Their biggest downside is that they are not very friendly towards new members, especially in older communities. Combined systems are a combination of cyclical permanent systems. They usually require usage of 2 separate bots to keep track of rankings on both leaderboards. They take best aspects of both systems, meaning they can be used both for rewards, which would be connected to cyclical system, security, which would be connected to permanent one. This also allows for cyclical leaderboard to help involve new users more, while still giving good insight of who most active members of all time are with permanent one. only big downside that remains is issue of removing roles from a large number of members. Negative Aspects As with any system, there are several negative aspects to consider when it comes to using XP systems. All of these should be taken into consideration before you make a decision on whether you want to use one. Some of most commonly voiced concerns would be following: fact that these systems encourage sending a larger number of messages automatically leads to idea of spam. Since spam is considered a violation of rules, as well as a ToS violation, this would become a huge problem. issue is easily resolvable, thanks to built in anti-spam measures XP systems have, primarily message cooldown. This, in combination with good moderation would make it certain that no spam is generated by presence of system. Since most XP systems require utilization of roles for truly fulfilling their usage, issue of role bloating comes to mind. It is important to manage space leveled roles properly in order to avoid creating an excessive number of roles with no real use in your server. It is believed that when it comes to rewarding members, rewards should be granted manually through qualitative judgement of content, rather than quantitative. Itas a fact that bots cannot themselves tell quality of messages sent. fact that all types of conversations allow users to gain XP means that there is no meter on what quality of conversation is. Granting privileges as a result of such conversations sends wrong idea of what sort of activity is encouraged. Only humans can truly judge content subjectively to determine quality. By combining proper moderation, for handling judgement of quality, built-in preventive mechanisms of XP systems for quantity control, this issue can be held down to a minimal level. This would be one of most difficult problems of system to resolve. Many members, with intent of increasing their XP count level, will attempt to hold conversation in community. This part of it is perfectly fine. problem arises when they start forcing conversation at any point in time solely to increase their message count. result would be communication that is completely unnatural unhealthy. This type of abuse of system canat really be stopped with cooldown system since most of time it is not spam. only real way to prevent this is to use No XP role, but difficulty of telling organic inorganic communication apart raises question: Was there really any violation of system? Not in every case is an XP system useful for a community. In many cases moderators canat figure out how they can add this sort of system make it seem like a natural part of server, how it can fit theme of community. Considering theme purpose of your server is an important part of making decision of adding a leveling system to your server. Before you make decision, ask yourself: How can I make this system a natural part of my community? Which Bot Do I Use? In following section, several publicly available bots will be presented as options for what you can use for an XP System in your server. following bots have been chosen based on data collected from a survey of various moderators, administrators owners in Discord communities. This list is not exhaustive. There are plenty of alternatives available online. All of listed bots are free public. Some features may be limited to paid additions private versions of bots. content of this article is not endorsed by any bot company related to bots. Gaius Play is an entertainment bot that also hosts an XP system. It takes both text voice chat activity into account. basic version comes with a preset configuration for XP gain leveling, as well as commands for adding rewards up to 6 roles, fully customizing toggling level-up messages, manually controlling XP, ignoring activity in certain channels ability to boost XP gain within certain parameters (roles, channels, time periods). It also has ability to remove leveled roles from all users, making it ideal for use in a cyclical system. Additionally, there are several premium features, such as unlimited reward roles a tree leveling system. Users can also reset their own reward roles in order to change paths on tree leveling system. Amari is a bot that is solely focused on leveling systems. It only looks at activity in text channels. This is a very simple bot, containing commands for setting rewards, manually controlling XP, customizing toggling level-up messages, as well as ignoring activity in some channels. It has ability to have 2 leaderboards active at same time, both of which can be reset at any point. Donor features allow for modification of cooldown between messages, as well as modification of XP gain per message. Nadeko is a multi-purpose bot with a leveling system module. It detects activity exclusively from text chat has a preset configuration for XP gain. It contains commands for setting up reward roles, toggling level-up messages, ignoring activity in channels manually controlling XP. A big upside of this bot is that you have option to host it yourself. This also adds ability to set up in-bot currency rewards, as well as better overall control of bot. Tatsu is another multi-purpose bot with an XP system module. It has several basic commands, allowing creation of reward roles, toggling level-up announcements, modifying XP gain per message cooldown, manual XP control ignoring channel activity. It also features a dashboard a global leaderboard alongside local one. Summary With available selection of bots documentation explaining setup of XP systems, using leveling modules is simpler than ever. configuration options that exist on these modules allow for creative usage of leveling systems with goal of passively increasing activity within community. Naturally, you have to consider several factors prior to deciding on using XP systems. If you are considering using one, think of how you can best integrate it into your community. In which way will you use it? Which type of system would suit your community best? Which bot would be best for task? Of course, there are negative aspects to consider as well, meaning youad have to figure out how to control minimize them. Carefully weigh all pros cons prior to making a final decision. Creating Moderation Team Channels Moderation Channel Setup Once confident in channel permissions that lock access to your private moderation channels, itas important to think about what you want your moderation channels to look like. larger server more channels you may need to accommodate everything. An important rule of thumb is to make sure that your moderation channels are an exception to any auto-moderated actions your moderation bot may be taking, that automoderator is configured not to act on messages from moderators. No blacklists should be in effect in these channels to ensure proper discussion of punishments happenings in server can be discussed truthfully respectfully. Itas also important to ensure that any message logging is configured to ignore channels that not all moderators have access to. For example, if all of your moderators can see a general action log channel, but you have a separate channel for a lead chat, deleted edited messages from that channel should not be logged for privacy reasons. More about this can be found below. Structurally, it is recommended to have informational channels at top of your moderation channel category to make sure everyone sees them. Anything that should be easily viewable by team follows, such as an update channel moderation/action logging based channels. Channels restricted to smaller groups of moderators should be closer to bottom as less people have access to these, partnership channels meant to maintain relations as opposed to direct moderation connections can be on bottom. A sample of a large staff channelset can be found below. a a Weall now begin to outline a variety of channels that are often useful for moderation purposes. below list is for your consideration when building your own moderation channel category, but by no means should you feel obligated to add every channel discussed below to your server. This is all about recognizing your needs making sure they are met! Every moderation team should have a developed moderation handbook that is easily accessible to all team members updated regularly. However, some moderation teams like to have an overview channel for rule enforcement for quick referencing. This channel can contain information such as how you categorize punishments, an overview of popular commands for easy referencing after returning from a moderation break, links to all guidelines moderation forms for easy coordination. We recommend that this channel is viewable to all moderators, but Send Message permissions for informational channels like this should be limited to server owner administrators to ensure only important select information is fed into channel. Additionally, denying Manage Message permissions to everyone but administrators is also recommended to ensure that these informational messages arenat deleted. Action logs are most important moderation channels out there, but also busiest. Moderation action logs exist for a variety of purposes, you can configure them however you see fit. Some recommended actioning channels include, but are not limited to: Like your server, your moderation team can have a general channel. While it is important for your moderators to moderate, itas also important for your team to bond. This is best achieved by having a space that is not dedicated to moderation. It exists to talk to each other, get to know each other, build rapport in your team environment. Moderation can be stressful, this is where you can go to take a break with your teammates. However, it is important to maintain same set of moderation expectations here as you would in public channels. An occasional vent is understood acceptable, but you should avoid speaking negatively of server members that can taint a moderation experience. While itas important to bond with your teammates, it is also important to bond with your server members as well. Chatting in server itself is just as encouraged as getting to know your fellow moderators. If you enable community server option for your server, youall have updates fed to a chosen channel. As these will be major community-based updates for moderation purposes, it is often recommended to have them feed to a moderation update memo based channel for ease of viewing. Channels that serve this purpose can be used for a variety of reasons including announcing extended absences from team for vacations mental health purposes to avoid burnout, taking team-wide votes, making announcements for moderator removals, departures, promotions, initiatives team is pursuing. Many servers use a single channel as a catch-all update arena as it serves a very specific purpose will not be used daily. Although there are a variety of ways to organize your team hierarchy, in addition to regular moderators most mod teams also have administrators who are responsible for overseeing regular moderators. Some mod teams also make a distinction between regular moderators moderators-in-training, who may have different permissions compared to regular moderators otherwise be subject to additional scrutiny during their training period. If these distinctions exist within your own mod team, it may be wise to create separate administrator channels training channels. Administrator Channels - An administrator chat is necessary to speak about private matters on team. This is to judge general moderation performance, handle punishments for problematic actions internally, it also serves as a place to handle any reports against moderators to ensure privacy. Please remember, it is important that these messages are not caught up in bot logging so moderators are not made aware of fact that they are being discussed privately before leads connect with them. Training Channels - General permissions granted to all moderators will not yet be accessible to moderator trainees, thus some teams consider locking their access to select channels. There will need to be a space for all moderators leads to privately discuss growth of trainees without them gaining access even after promotion. Some teams may go as far as to establish a unique action log channel used during training periods before giving them access to full history of moderation team once they prove their ability to be unbiased moderators. Again, it is important to ensure that discussion channels for trainees are exceptions to basic bot logging to avoid awkward occurrences with trainees seeing commentary about them that they should not see yet. There are a plethora of moderation channels that can benefit a team in unique circumstances that donat fit into above categories. Consider following when thinking about what fits best for how your community is run: If your community is linked to an external community such as Reddit Twitch, it would be useful to have separate moderation channels dedicated to this external community in addition to your Discord moderation channels. Reddit moderation channels specifically can be created by utilizing webhooks. Reddit moderation spaces housed on Discord often have r/modnews updates feeding into a special update area channel sets unique to their external community needs. You can also have new posts comments logged into a designated Reddit action log for easy reference without opening Reddit. Teams that have a separate Reddit Twitch moderation team in addition to their Discord moderation team may have designated hangout spaces for all teams to get to know each other casually. But, most importantly, they may have shared moderation spaces to discuss troublemakers that can span multiple platforms to flag problematic users for other team. Easy specialized communication across teams will help to keep all facets of your community safe! Conclusion There is no right wrong way to set up a moderation channel category outside of ensuring you utilize correct permissions. Itas important to consider needs of your community how their needs translate to needs of your team when creating your moderation space. Having flexibility a willingness to grow as your server grows requires change is imperative. While action logs are most useful kind of moderation channels from a punishment perspective, hangout spaces are important to establishing team cohesion rapport. Identifying needs of your team making sure they are adequately met will help you create strongest moderation environment as possible. Schools X Discord Benefits of Using Discord in Classrooms Lots of new opportunities are created for schools who make use of a private Discord server. One of biggest opportunities is presented in a cultural shift away from formality closer to general bonding. Gone are days of formal communications over e-mail instead we have open chat discussions with teachers, fellow classmates, group project members, even private one-on-oneas (similar to office hours!) when necessary. In this section we seek to discuss many ways that Discord can help virtual learning. Discord can function as a virtual classroom setting in ways that can generate new opportunities for continued reliable teamwork while enabling new exciting ways for students to connect with each other. Utilizing Discord as a Virtual Classroom While certain permissions are essential to creating an environment that separates teachers student private chats subjects, a classroom environment acts as overall hub for everything necessary from a full school, to a specific classroom, to separate groups working on projects, even a variation of subjects being taught. Simultaneously, a server can be set up to serve a variety of school-related functions including, but not limited to: Discord naturally lends itself to communication in ways that allow students to help each other. If one student is stuck on an assignment, any student can answer their question perhaps join them in a study session to work out problem together. Schoolwork can feel less solitary, there is less of a reliance on teachers aids, students who may be taking same subject in different classes can meet each other help each other out. This also allows teachers to monitor such a space to gain insight as to where their students are struggling so they can adjust their lesson plans accordingly. Interaction with each other doesnat have to be limited to just typing in designated channels. Students can interact with each other teachers while using subject specific audio and/or video channels as well, allowing them to have more personal interactions cater to different learning styles. However, if you are using these channels to broadcast a lesson not promote group work, make sure that you disable voice activity for students to avoid accidental noise from being broadcasted throughout your online classroom. This helps create a controlled environment for all involved in virtual classroom space. An example about how to do this is below. Discordas Easy to Use Interface Will Make Students Feel at Home Discord was created for housing online communities which sets it apart from other routes taken for e-learning platforms. Your students staff will feel at home in Discord user interface because it is easy to use made for quick adaptation. natural familiarity that many students may bring from their personal usage of platform even other similar platforms will reduce friction of adopting into new virtual learning atmospheres more easily help transition Discord into their daily educational routines. A common complaint in larger classroom settings, both in person virtually, is that environment is impersonal. In a sea of many faces, it is understandable that a student may feel like just another number on attendance roster. However, Discordas premise of providing an easily built space meant for easy informal communication can reduce this lack of personal connection instead help students feel welcome, including, easily engaged. a There is Always Fun to be Had in a Healthy Community When creating your virtual classroom it is important to keep in mind what you want purpose of your server to be. A server for a specific math classroom taught by Mr. Wumpus at noon everyday is going to be geared entirely towards education, whereas a more open-concept Algebra server that welcomes all students currently enrolled in course under various teachers to have a more common meeting space while also being split into their respective virtual classrooms via permissions allows for antics in addition to education. Educational settings can also be fun if you choose to build them that way. There is always fun to be had in a healthy community when school day finishes, providing this hang out space for students will allow them to not only bond but associate positive feelings with school. There can be spaces designated to help students study together in after school hours perhaps come together to take a study break to play one of their favorite games. A music bot can be used to listen to music in an essay-writing sprint, a leveling system can be used to reward students for participation. Community feelings lead to happiness, which can impact mental health grading. Discord is an Extension of your Physical Campus Discord also brings many advantages to educational arenas outside of classroom. A server can be viewed as an extension of your physical campus to Internet in an e-learning environment. Similar to a real-life campus, Discord is a meeting place for students staff to chat, get to know each other, build a stronger community in places they feel safe. Shy students may even find it easier to bond better in an online environment than a physical one which can lead to generating new friendships while also improving pre-existing ones. Students who perceive a welcoming environment have positive feelings about their school community will often get better grades because of higher motivations levels. Interestingly, a further extension of a physical campus would be to an alumni association. While school related Discord servers are often for study tools virtual classrooms, they can also serve as special places for alumni to connect after graduation. They can not only catch up with their old classmates, but they can mentor current students as well. Such a situation can be brought about via unique ideas like career fairs oriented towards advising current students about future career options by making use of a schoolsa alumni network. Disadvantages of Using Discord as a School Platform As mentioned above, Discordas widespread usage for personal gaming easy to use interface means that a lot of students could already use Discord in their free time begin to adopt it into their lives after being introduced to it in a classroom setting. person someone may present themselves as online can differ from who they are in real life. When given opportunity to use a profile picture, set usernames nicknames, even statuses, things can get out of hand quickly. It may even be difficult for some teachers to identify which student is behind certain accounts if these expectations arenat established immediately upon server creation. With likely change that a student might not want to use a picture of themself as their profile picture, it is important to establish server guidelines about what is appropriate to be in that photo. While some users may not be comfortable using their full name even their first name in their username, set expectation that everyone has to change their nickname in your private school-related Discord servers to their real name. On a related note, if a user is subscribed to Discord Nitro, they may also change their profile picture on an individual server basis. However, it's not required in order to use Discord on whole. Our recommendation if a student is uncomfortable with using their real picture for their platform-wide account is to tell them to make a secondary account specifically for school where they can use a photo of themselves. With Discord's account switcher feature having a second account for this purpose is less of hassle. Finally, when students first enter server, we recommend enabling Developer Mode to privately connect each individual User ID to a student should someone alter change their identity/account information in future. This could be done through schools information management system, just by using a spreadsheet. It is also imperative to reiterate boundary that you expect everything present in virtual school ecosystem to be school appropriate. Features like profile pictures, username, status are platform-wide features that appear in all servers a user is in. What is appropriate in some spaces may not be appropriate in school. Consider this ahead of time to establish rules around this also punishments should this not be respected. It is important to keep in mind that Discord does have strict Terms of Service Community Guidelines that state users arenat allowed to use NSFW content other forms of illegal content as their username, profile picture, and/or status. This will partly make sure content on their profiles is acceptable to a degree. However, you may not be comfortable if a student is cursing in your virtual classroom that can be dealt with accordingly by you. Conclusion Discordas very purpose is to foster communication by bringing users an easy to understand interface that is adaptable to a variety of needs, thus making it a really useful modern tool for e-learning virtual classrooms. With right permissions, students can be brought into environments where they can not only learn, but also have fun in a virtual extension of their physical campus. Through utilization of a variety of ways to teach classrooms communicate amongst groups, Discord naturally fosters teamwork open forum discussions between students teachers alike. However, Discord is still a platform with millions of users exploring a variety of interests. Itas important to enter Discord prepared to handle students who may be using inappropriate media for school via platform-wide features like profile pictures, statues, usernames because they are appropriate elsewhere. If you consider logistics of creating a safe, school-appropriate environment set expectations guidelines upon entry, Discord is a great tool for your future educational needs! Confidentiality in Moderation Considerations Regarding Leadership Whichever moderation roles a server may have, there should always be an authority role that can make calls at their discretion if they believe it is best thing for community. A good example on how to do just that can be found here. Moderation administrators, leaders, managers, etc. should always be prepared ready to make judgment calls on information provided to them, whether by mods users. A very common misconception among moderation teams is that they should share all information amongst team for transparency. This can be a double-edged sword in sense that disclosing private information that is not essential for a moderator can open more routes for that information to have unauthorized distribution. If this occurs, it will compromise privacy trust of users that information applies to. In sensitive situations containing very volatile information, consider if it may be beneficial to have it handled directly by a team leader even owner of community. Personally identifiable information (or PII) is any information that can identify a user, such as an email address, full name, phone number, IP address, exact location, even their Discord user ID username. People should never disclose someoneas personal information except their own in an appropriate environment, as disclosing othersa info can be treated as doxxing, which is a disclosure of personal info by a third party (for example, someone posting another useras address), can, in some instances, be actioned on by Trust Safety as it may violate Discordas Terms of Service/Community Guidelines. User IDs usernames are acceptable as long as there is a justifiable need to disclose it, but make sure to always consider if there may be repercussions to that user if disclosed in any instance. PII is very sensitive as it removes a useras privacy can result in them being targeted online even in real life. Thus, this information should always be protected with utmost discretion. Moderators may come in contact with this in ways such as a message they have to delete, someone maliciously doxxing another person, a user accidentally sharing it without realizing harm they are putting themselves in even from information included in a report. This information typically should not be disclosed to anyone community leaders should consider removing it from bot logging channels to protect a useras identity. Also consider encouraging members of your community to learn how to safeguard their own information. You can include rules within your communities that discourage sharing of even oneas own personal information. As important as it is to protect other users, it is just as important to help them protect themselves. Users may sometimes share their information out of good will as a way of attempting to bond with others, but bad actors can use that information maliciously. Personal matters can refer to a huge range of information, but some common examples can include relationships, interpersonal conflicts, previous history, things as simple as a DM private conversation. As a moderator you may very likely come across information involving this as part of reports, concerns, even someone breaching trust by screenshotting sharing private messages. This information is extremely important to protect as people may trust you to keep it private use it only to take care of issue at hand. Exposures of this information can be very harmful to people can result in targeted harassment, bullying, even further negative consequences. Stories of this can cause people to be concerned even worried about reporting something for fear of it happening to them. In end, this makes things very difficult for moderators to not only reassure, but to rectify. Most public communities have ways of protecting their server with moderation tools, actions, procedures. This includes moderator actions such as warnings, kicks, mutes, bans, etc. Moderation actions may be especially important when it involves a specific user. A Moderation info can even include internal details such as protocol, procedure, censor lists, even bot details. Moderation information is something that can vary from server to server, thus it is relatively up to discretion of each moderation team to instill their own server rules to enforce. Some may have full transparency with an open log channel, some may take a more confidential approach only speak with those involved. Both have their pros cons, but be sure to weigh what could happen if people know who receives what penalties. For protocol, always remember to carefully decide what to share publicly, as disclosing a procedure can lead to someone using that information to evade moderators even exploit server. This also stands true with bots, as disclosing bot details such as configuration censor list can result in users evading protections put in place by your team. a There are many different forms of information that must be considered heavily before disclosing to different people, whether they be users other mods. Information can range from sensitive personal information such as emails, names, phone numbers, location, IP address, etc. to community-related information such as mod actions, previous incidents, user history. Regarding users, very little should be shared to people who are not involved. When it comes to fellow mods, it is always best to share as much information as is reasonable aside from personal information to ensure everyone has a well-informed mindset. Some questions to consider when speaking with users include: Now for mods members of more internal team on servers, mods should of course be ain loopa to know story of a situation, itas never recommended to keep mod teams in dark. That being said, even with other moderators, be careful about sharing unnecessary information, especially personally-identifying information, not only because there is often little benefit to it, but primarily because it compromises a useras privacy even if behind closed doors. A While there are fewer factors to consider, they are still just as important as ones you would ask for another user. Some things to consider when disclosing to moderators include: Remember that if you arenat sure if you should disclose something related to moderation, always ask an administrator/leader on your server for guidance, always dispose of private information if it is not needed. Benefits of Confidentiality It may be easier to be fully transparent not have to check every sentence before it is said sent. That being said, there are many benefits to upholding a consistent, confidential environment where staff act with discretion when assisting with a variety of matters. There are many consequences if confidentiality is not upheld properly. Below are some examples of benefits of protecting information as well as consequences that can come with being overly transparent. Keeping Pseudonymous. As stated by Discordas Safety Principles, Discord is pseudonymous, which means that your account on Discord doesnat need to be tied back to your identity. A Protecting users who may provide information as evidence otherwise may sometimes expose who they are, protecting this information reassures that their personal life wonat be compromised by socializing confiding in a serveras staff. Trust. Users will know of hold high trust within a staff team if they are confident that high expectations of privacy will be respected by team they confide in. If not upheld, users will find it difficult to trust team, may heavily contemplate even refrain contacting a moderation team again in future. User Safety. Diligent protection of user data information helps protect users as it prevents unwanted data from getting into wrong hands. If information is not guarded, information that gets into wrong hands can result in targeted harassment bullying, as many private details can reveal information to malicious individuals. Moderator Safety. Keeping moderation actions confidential only disclosing information to people who need to know helps to keep moderator anonymity reinforces idea of a team decision. Disclosing moderation actions who performed them can put a target on mod, as people may treat them personally responsible for an action may result in harassment disrespect from users who may not understand decision. Personally identifiable information being shared outside of need to know groups can result in compromising users making them feel as if they may need to sacrifice their Discord to retain personal privacy. This leads to a loss of trust from member, perhaps even loss of them as a member of your community. Designing Server for Privacy There are multiple things to be mindful of when considering privacy confidentiality, it extends well beyond standard moderation. Often, privacy will fall down to way that server is configured. Some things to consider include: Server Discoverability. If an LGBTQ+ server is in Server Discovery, a user may use an emote from that server in another one, if someone clicks on emote, it may accidentally expose user as they may identify as LGBTQ+ privately but not publicly. Public Join Messages. Some servers may have awelcome botsa even Discordas welcome feature that greets new users publicly upon joining. Server staff should take into account type of community that they stand for, consider if users may perhaps feel uncomfortable exposed by being mentioned immediately upon joining. Security. Automated security agatekeeper botsa may be used to prevent malicious users from joining a server on alt accounts as part of malicious groups. While this seems perfectly normal, part that has to be considered is what data you are requesting. Some of these bots may collect IP addresses, browser data, various other forms of information. Users may not be comfortable in supplying information that could compromise who they are. Always make sure to read through privacy statement of any bot that you add to ensure that you are not asking for too much information from regular members. Bot Logging. Many servers have private log channels maintained by one more bots. This tracks joins, leaves, deleted edited messages, even more. There are two main points to be wary of with these: if personal information is posted for any reason, be it accidentally by misclick maliciously to dox a user, it will usually appear in a moderator logging channel when deleted. After situation has been dealt with, owners admins should consider deleting log message to prevent personal information from persisting within that channel. Keeping Balance There are pros cons to any level of disclosure that is offered by a server to its community its staff. It is not black white there are gray areas in both transparency revealing select information with moderator discretion. There must always be a balance of both that may shift depending on situation at hand type of community that is present. Just as complete confidentiality will lead to distrust, total transparency will lead to users feeling unprotected due to a lack of privacy. Ban Evasion Advanced Harassment Understanding High Conflict Persons (HCPs) vast majority of community members are interested willing to participate according to platform rules, even if they might not agree with every one of them. Sometimes people break rules disagree, but their behavior can be quickly corrected they can learn from their mistakes. If users continue to break rules, they may be given longer-term even permanent bans from community platform. Most users will accept their ban, but a small fraction will not. A 2018 study by Stanford University estimated that 1% of subreddit communities on Reddit initiate 74% of all conflict on platform. This incredibly small percentage of users rank extremely low in agreeableness personality trait, have no interest in getting along with others. Only a trained clinical psychologist can diagnose a patient with a disorder, but a term commonly used prior to diagnosis is HCP (high-conflict people). There are four primary characteristics of high conflict personalities, which is not a diagnosis but their description of specific conflict behavior: If you fail to use tact in your moderation technique communication approaches, you may find that you your community become target of a high-conflict person. They may spam your community you may delete their posts ban their accounts, but more accounts can be created. Discord uses IP bans to prevent users from creating new accounts, but VPNs can be used to circumvent these bans. If truly motivated, armies of bot accounts can be created used for mass-spamming, members of your community can be doxed, ISPs platforms can be DDoSad to create fear in your community. If a high-conflict person gains access to money, they can pay somebody else to do work for them. Most moderators choose to simply wait out harassment. Advanced harassment like this may go on for several days, even weeks, but then stop abruptly as individual turns their attention to something new in their life. In some cases harassment can go on for months, continuing to escalate in new ways that may put lives of your team community members in danger. What can you do to protect your community from High Conflict Persons? What motivates a person to behave like this? This article will help to explain motivations behind this persistent, destructive behavior, provide actionable steps to reduce resolve their harassment. Virtue of Battling a Nemesis A anemesisa is an enemy rival that pursues you relentlessly in search for vengeance. A nemesis typically holds some degree of fascination for a protagonist, vice versa. Theyare an antagonist whoas bent on revenge, who doesnat go away, who seems to haunt mind of protagonist. Theyave moved past being an enemy to become something much more personal. You might assume that a high-conflict person harassing your community is your nemesis, but this would be incorrect. Youare not going out of your way to obstruct their behavior, your primary focus is to engage moderate your community. If harassment stopped, you would move on forget about their behavior. You resist their behavior only as long as it falls under your realm of influence. In their mind, you have become their nemesis, you must be punished for your insolence. To them, you are Architect of an oppressive Matrix, President Snow of an authoritarian Hunger Games, tyrannical Norsefire government in V for Vendetta. You your community represent opposite of what they believe. In one way another, either by your direct actions through your association with your community, you have wronged them deserve to suffer for your behavior. Itas clear that you will never learn understand what they see. You not only participate in creating corrupt unjust system that they are oppressed by fight against, but as a moderator, you are very lynchpin that maintains corrupt system. You may believe this sounds outlandish, you would be correct. Most people donat believe that world is out to get them, that theyall be hunted down persecuted for what they believe. These individuals have an overactive threat detection system that makes them believe that you your community are actively plotting their downfall. They take your opposing stance as a direct challenge to their competence, authority autonomy. They harass you your community because they believe that youare out to get them, want to replace them their way of life. truth is, all you really want them to do is follow rules maintain a civil conversation. Understanding Tactical Empathy Now that you have a better understanding of how somebody like this thinks, weall discuss strategies that you can employ to solve this problem. goal is NOT to get them to seek help change their mind- we arenat attempting to solve people. Instead, our goal is to prevent stop certain negative behaviors that keep happening so that you can protect your community focus your energy elsewhere. key to getting an individual like this to change their behavior is through utilizing atactical empathya. Tactical empathy is use of emotional intelligence empathy to influence anotheras behavior establish a deal relationship. It is not agreeing with them, but just grasping recognizing their emotions positions. This recognition allows us to act appropriately in order to respond to our counterpartas position in a proactive deliberate manner. premise behind tactical empathy is that no meaningful dialogue takes place when we are not trusted we are perceived as a threat. In order to get someone to stop harassing your community, you need to shift yourself from being villain of their story to being just another random person in their lives. You must work to shatter persona that they have projected onto you show that you are not enemy working to destroy them. Youare just a mod trying to keep your community safe. By demonstrating that you understand respect them as an individual, this will disarm them allow them to focus their energy elsewhere. It will not change their opinion, but at least their behavior will change. A Modas Guide to Situation Diffusal When somebody continues to harass disrupt your community, theyare essentially holding your community hostage. If someone truly is holding your community ahostagea, theyare often doing so because theyare looking to open a dialogue for negotiation. Frequently, people take hostages because they need somebody to listen. They arenat getting attention that they believe they deserve, attempt to cause as much disruption as possible in order to make their case. You are a community moderator negotiating peace of your community, not their lives, but these tactics can still apply. Situation diffusal can generally be defined by three primary processes, each designed to collect information use it to disarm high-conflict person from believing that youare an enemy threat. These processes are called Accusations Audit, Mirroring to Understand Getting to aThatas Righta. An accusations audit is where you focus not on just things that they believe, but things that they believe you did wrong. An accusation Audit is not based on logic - itas based on unfiltered emotions of other person. Itas important that you go through their early comments messages to understand what prompted this behavior in first place. This might have been banning them for breaking a rule not properly punishing another community member that they got into an argument with. They might believe aI feel like you didnat give me a chance to explain myselfa aI feel like youare discriminating against mea. Your understanding of their beliefs will be flawed inaccurate, but you must do your best to piece it together into a coherent argument on their behalf. If possible, learn more about other communities theyare a part of. Identify if theyare harassing any other communities, reasons for doing so. Are there any commonalities of note? Once you believe youave figured out why theyare upset with you your community, mirror their language to verify it. At this point, opening a dialogue might be incredibly difficult if theyare using throwaway accounts regularly. Chances are they do have a primary account they continue to use in other communities, which can help greatly with starting your dialogue. At this stage, youare still working to collect information about what they believe, directly from source. Examples of questions you can use to verify their opinions include, aIt seems like you believe that Iam being unfair because I didnat give you a chance to explain yourself.a aIf I understand correctly, you believe Iave been discriminating against you instead of taking your opinion seriously, is that right?a Chances are, responses you receive will be filled with aggression, profanity insults. You must ignore all of this, continue working to understand their position events that resulted in them targeting your community. Negotiations like this are difficult in voice-to-voice communication, nearly impossible via instant private messaging. They will be incredibly resistant at first, perhaps thinking that youare attempting to trick them into a perjury trap for them to admit their guilt ignorance. When you get them talking to you, mirror that language to get them to elaborate further on their beliefs. An example of dialogue might go something like following: Spammer: aItas bullshit that mods ban strawberry jam lovers because blueberry jam lovers are afraid of being exposed for who they really are.a Mod: aAfraid of being exposed?a Spammer: aYeah, blueberry jam lovers are secretly running world plotting against anyone who doesnat believe in same jam flavor preferences as they do.a Realistically, blueberry jam lovers are not actually running world plotting anything nefarious, but in mind of spammer this is undeniably true. while this example was intentionally mild, you can infer more severe types of conversations that would follow a similar format. Regardless, as you dig further into what they believe, youall notice that rabbit hole will go very deep be filled with logical fallacies obviously disprovable biases that make no sense. Remember that truth reality behind what they believe is completely irrelevant, attempts to correct them will undermine your goals. Your job is to help them explain their beliefs to you to best of their ability, for you to understand their position to best of your ability. Once you believe youave collected enough information, you can move to final step, getting to aThatas Right.a Once you believe youave completely understood their position what they believe, you can repeat their entire position back to them. Demonstrate your understanding by effectively summarizing it concisely accurately, regardless of how much you disagree with position. Donat focus on their behavior actions that resulted in them getting banned. Instead, focus exclusively on ideology that drove their behavior. Do this until youare able to get them to say aYes, thatas righta at least 3 times, by asking if thereas anything else that you forgot in your summary. If you did miss anything, repeat entire position again while including extra information. When reiterating their points, be very careful about restating things that are not true. Do your best to remove personal bias from statements to focus them back to aabsolute truths.a Their actions are about trying to make a point- but what youare doing is getting them to make their point without taking action, because you have heard what they are trying to say. If you do this well enough, if you put enough effort into doing this correctly (and it doesnat need to be perfect), they will know that you finally understand where theyare coming from that theyave been heard by you, their opinion has been validated. By demonstrating you understand their position, you go from being part of problem to being a real person. They might not like you, but they will at least (if begrudgingly so) respect you. When you successfully reach this state of your discussion, itas essential that you be careful with your choice of words. Thereas a good chance that spammer will leave your community alone now that they know that their opinion has been recognized. At very least, you should see an immediate reduction in number of times they attempt to cause harm. If they do continue to harass you your community, itas possible that you failed to address primary reason that theyare upset. Open dialogue with them again follow steps above from beginning, check to see that you havenat fallen into a common pitfall mistake. Common Pitfalls Mistakes Below is a list of common examples of mistakes people make during negotiations: When using tactical empathy, remember that purpose of exercise is to bring their beliefs to conscious mind demonstrate agreement. If you attempt to tell them what they should believe, you may instead get a ayouare righta fail to see any change. difference is subtle, but important. Make sure that other side actually feels heard, that youave fully understood their position. Donat Try to Correct their Opinion As a reminder: do not attempt to correct modify their opinion. Remember purpose of this process. It is not to modify their position opinion, itas only to mirror their opinion to stop identifying you your community as a threat. methodology outlined in this article is designed for conversations in real-life, especially over phone. Itas unlikely that youall be able to get spammer on an audio call, so itas essential to be patient with process careful with your wording. Formal grammar like punctuation can make a sentence feel more serious threatening. Use casual phrasing make an occasional spelling mistake to show youare human. If youare uncertain about tone, read sentence out loud while sounding as angry as you can, adjust accordingly. process outlined here can be easily undermined by others who arenat involved in process. If youare working to negotiate with a spammer but another moderator is threatening them in a different conversation, you wonat see any changes in their behavior. Communicate with your team on strategy you plan to use, remember to ask for emotional support step away if it becomes too taxing. Can High-Conflict People be Helped? There will be some of you who believe that after getting this far, you may be on path to rehabilitating a person like this. mistake is believing that you are further along than you really are, that youare qualified to help someone struggling to control their emotions. truth is, getting to athatas righta is only 1% of process. Even if youare a clinical psychologist, you wouldnat be getting paid for your work, at least not this work. Attempting to provide support via text chat will have diminishing returns. Attempting to show somebody like this aerror of their waysa may result in all of work you have done being reversed. Instead, you must focus on people who want your help who need it- this being people in your community. Empower people who are truly deserving of your time energy. At end of day, youare a human a moderator. Your primary focus in this realm is to make sure your community is safe stays safe- if youave managed to get persistent spammer to stop then youave accomplished what it is youave aimed to do. Facilitating Positive Environments Introduction core foundation of a server on Discord is community that populates it. Your community is what you engage with, protect, grow over time. Engagement is important to focus on, but itas just as important to make sure you are facilitating positive welcoming engagement. Why Positive Environments are Important Positive engagement can mean a lot of things, but in this article, we will be referring to way in which moderation can affect culture of server you are moderating. As moderators your policies, knowledge of your community, deductive skills influence way in which your community engages with each other with your team. When you establish nurture your community, you are growing a collective group of people who all enjoy at least some of same things. Regardless of your server topic, you are undoubtedly going to have members across different a variety of ethnicities, sexual orientations, identities from across world. Ensuring that your space on Discord is a space for them to belong necessitates making it safe for them to feel like they can be themselves, wholly, without reservation. Your members are all humans, all community members, all people that deserve respect deserve to be welcomed. Establishing Community Boundaries in Moderation When you are establishing your community, itas important to have a basic understanding of what kind of environment you would like your server to be. Itas good to break down general moderation philosophy on what content discussion youad like your community to engage in what content would be inappropriate given space. Depending on topic of your server these goals may be different, but some common questions you can ask to establish general boundaries are: Moderating Hateful Content When it comes to content you allow moderate in your server, itas important to, again, reflect on what type of community you are. Itas also important that you act quickly precisely on this type of harmful behavior. Some users will slowly push boundaries on what type of language they can aget away witha before being moderated. When discussing moderation, a popular theory that circulates is called broken windows theory. This theory expresses that if there are signs of antisocial behavior, civil unrest disorder, as well as visible signs of crimes in area, that it encourages further anti-social behavior crime. Similarly, if you create an environment in which toxic hateful behavior is common, cycle will perpetuate into further toxicity hatefulness. What is Bad-Faith Content vs. Good-Faith Content? aBad-faitha content is a term that describes behavior done intentionally to cause mischief, drama, A toxicity to a community. They are also commonly referred to as bad actors, are type of people that should be swiftly dealt with addressed directly. aGood-faitha content is a term that describes user behavior with good intentions. When users are a positive foundation in your community, members that join interact with established community will grow to adapt speak in a way that continues positive environment that has been fostered established. Itas important to note that while agood-faitha users are generally positive people, it is possible for them to state wrong sometimes even harmful words. importance of this distinction is that these users can be educated from their mistakes adapt to behavior you expect of them. When users toe line, they are not acting within good faith. As moderators, you should be directly involved enough to determine what is bad-faith content remove it. On other hand, education is important in community sphere for long term growth. While you can focus on removing bad behavior from bad-faith users, reform in good-faith community members who are uneducated in harmful rhetoric should also be a primary goal when crafting your community. When interacting in your community, if you see harmful rhetoric a harmful stereotype, step back meaningfully think about implications of leaving content up in channels that use this kind of language. Does it: Ideas to Help Prioritize Inclusivity A core way to handle all de-escalation stands in your approach. Users, when heated up during a frustrating toxic discussion, are easy to set off to accidentally escalate to more toxicity. key is to type calmly, to make sure with whatever manner you approach someone to de-escalate, you do it in a way that is understood to be for benefit of everyone involved. Closing Creating a healthy community that leaves a lasting, positive impact in its members is difficult. Moderators have to be aware, educated, always on lookout for things they can improve on. By taking initiative on this front, your community can grow into a positive, welcoming place for all people, regardless of their race, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation. Fundamentals of Family-Friendly Servers How Family-Friendly Servers Differ From Other Servers Because you are dealing with young people, family-friendly servers may become what many refer to as Home Servers. These are online communities that are perceived to be safe spaces that people come back to time again, like a home. Thus, such servers may attract users for different purposes than a community meant for college students might, for example. moderators of family-friendly servers can be viewed as both authoritative figures but also older siblings friends that may be looked up to by their community in unique parasocial relationships. They will also have unique experience of seeing many of their young users mature grow along with server. When forming this kind of environment, itas important to make sure your moderators are naturally empathetic to unique situations that will arise within member reports as a result of interpersonal relationships amongst younger users. During foundational stages of server building make sure to keep ideas such as privacy concerns, text filters, appropriate topics of discussions, rule continuity at forefront of your mind. Consider how you will handle users who are above traditional age range of family-friendly servers who may not wish to abide by these rules. While privacy concerns exist on any platform, they are something to be especially aware of when moderating family-friendly spaces. Rules that cover privacy internet safety may be more strictly enforced to protect younger server members from any harmful actors looking to take advantage of less experienced internet users. Oftentimes, these concerns can culminate in a blanket rule stating that sharing any personally identifying information in server is not allowed. This goes beyond exact locations can include full names, ages, even face reveals. Revealing exact locations full names are generally frowned upon in most online communities because they can be used to find more information about a potential doxxing target. Forbidding users to share their age is an added level of privacy to protect younger members seeking community on Internet from being taken advantage of by those with malicious intentions. Younger users may not understand how risky age differences can be to navigate. Face reveals can be reverse-image searched to further learn information about users who arenat protecting their online privacy, even be stolen used in various forms of bullying. As a result, many family-friendly servers find it best to limit all personally identifying information outside of first name country if users arenat choosing to utilize an online persona to protect themselves. As moderators itas important to help educate young users about how to maintain confidentiality use discretion when revealing personal information. This starts with recognizing not clicking malicious links steers into conversations about reporting things that make them uncomfortable in any way protecting their private information. Keep an eye out on how others interact with younger users act accordingly, as a victim may not realize they are a victim in some situations. Text filter implementation determining which topics of discussion are appropriate for server may be more strict than average community as a result of building a safe space for younger users. There is generally no room for crudeness in any form. A This goes beyond using text filters to monitor hate speech, which is against Discordas Community Guidelines, going further to include curse words, innuendo, illegal substances activities, gore, dark humor making light of serious situations, any negative harmful rhetoric from within fandom your community supports, more. Be sure to adapt your text filters as new situations filter evasions arise within your community. It is often recommended to keep your blacklist private to avoid exposing harmful terminology to users. Additionally, make sure your text filters mirror topics of discussion you arenat allowing in your server clearly outline those preferences in your server rules by noting that your environment is strictly SFW any NSFW content is not allowed. Automoderation can be utilized to mute ban users who are engaging in problematic discussion around hate speech, moderators can use their judgment on other blacklisted words as long as your moderation bot is set to log filtered words in moderation channels. As mentioned in previous section, rule continuity is a big deal in spaces meant for young people to ensure equal enforcement across everything. If youare looking to filter certain content, it should also not be allowed to discuss that topic in your server. This goes for both general chatting for various other forms of server usage, any place where there can be user generated content. One such example is meme art channels. While itas a great idea to foster encourage a healthy positive artistic environment, content that is NSFW, hate speech politically motivated, creations that may lean into age-restricted content like alcohol consumption gore should be monitored discouraged. If you have an active music channel setup, it might be worth keeping an eye on playlists to make sure content being monitored elsewhere doesnat slip by here. With release of server avatars, it is less likely that rule-breaking content can find its way into your server via this route, but consider moderating statuses of active users, user profiles, profile pictures if it does. It also helps to have your moderators lead by example follow same rules in their profiles that you are looking to enforce elsewhere. Continuity is key for equal unbiased rule enforcement. Considerations for Users Above Your Target Age Range While family-friendly environments exist to be safe spaces for young people you may find yourself also having users who are above your target age range. Their presence should not be discouraged, but itas important to ensure that your rules welcome messaging clearly defines your space as family-friendly so that they are aware of expectations for ANY user who joins server. Most will likely be accepting of rules youave put in place space you are trying to cultivate. However, others may naturally challenge certain restrictions that they find childish assume donat apply to them. Establishing language around why your community is meant to be family-friendly importance of keeping it safe for everyone as a result, will be helpful if these conversations arise. Users who may rebel against rules that they do not agree with should be actioned accordingly. If you notice a large portion of your userbase seeking out your community but growing frustrated with its family-friendly restrictions, you can consider opening locked channels for mature users that can either opt-in to their existence show proof of their age. If you decide to do this, make sure you have a separate set of rules in place for these channels, as well as an identification vetting process to make sure that younger users do not get exposed to content you donat want them to be exposed to. This would require moderation that is different from rest of your server, so itas important to consider whether not your moderation team can handle this locked channel if you feel it aligns with your serversa purpose. To Recap Family-friendly communities exist to welcome Discordas youngest users into safe spaces with protection of moderation teams. Home Servers are SFW communities that limit topics of discussion more than a generalized server would in order to cultivate that safe environment. As a result, thereas special consideration to be taken around user privacy educating users about their privacy, expanded text filters, appropriate topics of discussion, rule continuity when building out rules structure of such an environment. Make sure your team is prepared to handle older users who may find these rules constricting by explaining their importance to your communityas purpose. Understanding Avoiding Moderator Burnout Moderator Burnout: What is it? Starting a new job position activity will always be exciting. Most moderators are eager to help a community that they love that they are an active part of to grow prosper. You spend a lot of time there already, so why would you not want to do your part in helping that community be successful? However as time passes, interests can change initial enthusiasm can wane. As a moderator, you might find yourself spending time in other communities you realize your real world schooling work is a priority over moderating, so there is potential for anxiety to build as you try to juggle all of your responsibilities. Maybe your mental health is being affected by spending many hours a day on internet, dealing with trolls people who simply just want to cause trouble. This can mentally drain you, having to deal with negativity conflict day in day out. When moderating begins to feel like a chore, as opposed to a hobby, thatas when you might feel like moderator burnout has set in. Burnout is emotional, mental, physical exhaustion you feel after a prolonged period of stress brought on by certain activities. Spending too much time in a stressful environment can easily lead to feelings of exhaustion, feeling distant from activity task at hand, simply just having negative feelings when thinking about doing activity task. These negative effects on your body mind eat away at you until you feel like you are at your limit just do not have enough energy motivation in you anymore to continue moderating. Sometimes burnout makes it feel like only thing that can make you happy is to stop being a moderator completely. Signs of Moderator Burnout One of most common signs of moderator burnout is when you have been noticing yourself being less less active when it comes to moderating, as well as being less active in server itself. As a moderator, you have begun to feel like it is a chore for you to be moderating server; something you feel forced to do, knowing it needs to be done with no joy attached to task at hand. Time seems to move so slowly when you are moderating as you are constantly checking clock, just hoping that an hour of your time is enough on server. Your time spent on your server becomes less less as days go by until you have either stepped down completely withdrawn from any activity in server, moderation otherwise. A burgeoning lack of participation is another sign. If you know yourself well enough, you can probably tell when something is bothering you. Perhaps on any normal given day, you are social engage with your other team members as well as with regular server members, but recently youare only chatting in public channels, giving out occasional public warning. You notice that you only really check staff channels when there is a ping. Your account may be in server your name on member list, but youare no longer an active community member. At this point burnout has set in. There may be urge to come in every day give 100% but then you run risk of giving too much, too quickly. You start to dread amount of work necessary to do your part eventually start to taper off. You might notice yourself making more mistakes than normal. Frustration is another part of burnout that can affect mental aspects of moderating. Feeling like you are making too many mistakes are not doing as much as another moderator is a hard thing to put a reason to. Feelings of inadequacy may lead to reprimanding yourself internally, being your own worst critic, finding yourself in a rut, thinking everyone in server is being difficult. You know you are making mistakes, others on your team see it, thinking they are helping by giving you constructive criticism. There is a lack of accomplishment that makes you frustrated, especially in moderating. Nothing you do feels like it is being done right, adding that to difficulties of members of server, frustration kicks in. When telling members of server to do something they continue to post against rules, you begin to wonder if you matter are even making a difference. A Burnout can easily affect your attitude. Moderating tests your patience as some members of server will purposefully push line, seeing what they can get away with. As a new moderator, you might not be as strict, as you are wanting community to not only respect you but to like you. As time passes, your patience may begin to run thin you put up with a lot less while you get more irritated. You have a shift in your attitude can become bitter at what you have to deal with when moderating a server. Avoiding Moderator Burnout After taking time to look at signs of moderator burnout, it is important to know how to avoid it so you your team can find your groove again remember what it feels like to enjoy being not only a moderator but a community member. Everything is healthy with moderation, including, well, moderation. Knowing when you need breaks encouraging yourself, as well as other moderators, to take these breaks can really help with mounting stress levels. Moderating takes a toll on your mental health, so being able to step away catch your breath can really help reset your focus. Reach out to other members on your team that can help with moderator duties shoulder workload so those that are experiencing burnout can feel that it is okay to step away. A big part of working on a team is being honest with each other when things are good when things are not so good. You may be surprised at how eager your team members are to help prop you up when youare feeling low. Remember- you're not alone in this, so feel free to take those breaks be assured that server is not on fire that there are eyes other than yours that are there to share workload. Offline life your overall health should always come before any aspect of online life. Make sure you are not taking on too much, but also have enough to do. This can be a tricky balance. Depending on your moderation experience skills, it can be hard to determine what your work load capabilities are, especially as offline life changes. Be upfront honest with what your team expects from you, but also let them know that if you are feeling overwhelmed, that they can talk to you. Always have an open line of communication so you can find ways to help yourself, as well as others you moderate with. Something that has worked on larger servers that you might be able to incorporate to your server is having a summary of channels. With summary, you can have moderators on your team sign up for which channels they enjoy moderating, as well as others, not feel like you have to be in too many channels at one time. Delegating work makes it seem more manageable less daunting. Encourage yourself your fellow moderators to try new channels after a couple weeks to change everyoneas scenery, as well allowing various team members chance to interact with certain server members that might only hang out in channels that they donat normally moderate. As a moderator, you might feel yourself wanting to do more seek to add to your responsibilities. Suggesting community events helping out organizing running these events makes for a great change of pace to contrast normal moderating duties of watching chat. Events are great for bringing regular members together with moderators. It is a fun task that can bring activity levels up spread some excitement. Create an environment that is fun to moderate in. Having suggesting a staff channel where you your fellow moderators can be yourselves vent is a great way to relieve some stress have your team get to know one another. Ask them questions every day to encourage discussion communication between your entire team. Building a team that works well with one another helps with communication between fellow moderators, so they can express how everyone is feeling, seek advice on stresses in community. A You can get to know each otheras personal lives what other things in life might be causing outside stress. Getting to know each otheras personalities can help determine if someone might easily burn out if they are just more introverted than other moderators on your team. Holding events, such as game nights, where you all play a game online together can really help you other moderators feel at ease, bring enjoyment to everyone, help everyone reset for next day of moderating. One of biggest, perhaps simplest, things you can do to help with moderator burnout is just being thankful. Typing two little words of athank youa can go a long way. As a moderator, you spend your free time helping server, so let your fellow moderators know you appreciate that they chose this as their hobby. To that end, positive specific feedback is one of best ways to let someone know that they did a good job what exactly it was that they did well. By being specific about what youare thanking your moderator for, youare letting them know that their hard work is recognized valued seen. Recognize when they put in a lot of hours on server are here on a day-to-day basis. Finding ways to reward them, whether through gifting Nitro a special recognition in server, can be really fulfilling to them. It reassures them that they are an important part of server are making a difference when helping. Be gracious with your words remind them that they are here with you. It starts a chain reaction you will see moderators thanking other moderators for their hard work. Summary Moderator burnout can happen to anyone at any time. It is important to understand what it is how you can help. Whether you are an owner, administrator, another moderator, it is important to support your team look for signs of burnout so you can suggest ways that might help them in how they are feeling. Always have an open line of communication with your team that fosters honesty. Encourage them yourself to step away when feeling stressed overwhelmed, thank each other for helping in server. Servers are a lot harder to run when doing it alone; moderators that are excited to be there are an important part of making sure things operate smoothly. Patreon X Discord What, Exactly, is Patreon? Letas start with obvious question: what is Patreon? In case you are unfamiliar with Patreon, it is a subscription service for content creators similar to YouTube Memberships Twitch Subscriptions. Supporters ( hereby referred to as apatronsa) can pay a monthly fee to access content from creators they are supporting. This private content can cover a wide range of content including text posts, polls, videos, images, merchandise, more. possibilities are truly endless you, as a content creator, have control over how much value you place on content you produce distribute over Patreon. Patreon also uses tiered platforms based upon monetary commitment. For example, letas say you are a comic book creator that can generate an entire comic in a monthas time. You could charge patrons $5 to access works in progress, maybe snippets of story youare writing, behind scenes streams of you working on an anticipated page panel. At next $10 tier, patrons can gain access to whole comic as a reward, maybe even access polls to help you decide what to do next. Further, a $25 reward could be that patrons have complete access to your entire library, get a physical edition of your comic book sent to them! ideas are endless when it comes to what kind of rewards you can offer your patrons. In fact, one of new ways to explore rewards systems for patrons is via Discord. Why Create Discord Rewards? For content creators that use platforms like Patreon, providing rewards to patrons is an absolute necessity because it directly benefits those who choose to support you. One of simpler rewards creators can provide patrons is a Discord reward system automatically managed by Patreon Bot. An example of such an award allows you to assign one more roles to patrons in your Discord server based upon their subscription tier on Patreon. Once they have their designated roles, you can utilize channel permissions to provide your supporters with exclusive access to aspects of your server like hidden channels perhaps even hoist them in sidebar of your Discord server as an added bonus. This gives them closer access to you as a creator as well as your content your community. This, in turn, can make them feel appreciated as support perhaps allow them to see a direct impact of their support on your content. Installing a Discord Rewards System on Patreon first step to setting up Discord Rewards on Patreon is to have a Patreon account. Once youave started building your Patreon page (or have one completed), youall need to head into your aTiersa section of your page. Once in aTiersa section, pick tier youad like to grant access to your rewards in your Discord server. We recommend that this should be lowest tier youad allow patrons to subscribe at in order to receive a special role in a Discord server that we are presuming is public. Once youave selected your chosen tier, youall need to connect your Patreon to Discord. Now, letas make this reward a reality with following steps: Please note, if you created your server that you plan on adding to your Patreon, youall have no trouble finding it in server list mentioned in Step 4. If youave had a friend, moderator, maybe even a community manager create your server, you might not see it in this list. Make sure you have Manage Server permission in order to see it. If you donat, double check with server owner have them add it to one of your roles in order to successfully connect to Patreon. Customizing Your Discord Rewards With your Patreon page successfully linked with your Discord server, you may notice this message in Patreon: To finalize reward set-up, you need to create actual roles. We recommend creating a different role for each of Patreon tiers you have distinguishing roles by naming them after tiersa name amount of money pledged by patrons of each tier. For example, if you have a $50 per month Patreon tier named Top Contributor, you could name corresponding reward role either a$50a aTop Contributor.a This usually works out most suitably for future rewards, because you can easily distinguish your followers who send $5 a month, versus those sending $50 a month, change role permissions accordingly if you are offering them different levels of Discord access. Remember that it is important to keep Patreon Botas role above all other roles we make for this purpose so it can help manage them. Now that your tier roles are in server, there should be no more red warning text on Patreon Tier Creation page. If there is, give it a quick refresh. disappearance of this text means that you can now check box aGives patrons access to selected Discord roles.a If you are using multiple roles for each tier of your Patreon for organization in your server, make sure theyare all added. After setting your channels permissions spoken about in next step, double check that correct role in your Discord server is associated with proper tier on your Patreon page. Success! Youave completed Patreon Discord integration! Now lets establish accessibility levels. At this point, youall want to build a structure to your server for these new tier roles. Head back to channel list decide how youad like to reward your different tiers. Do you want each tier to have their own channel category, do you want one channel category with different channels designated to different tiers? Make sure to give each category and/or channel permissions associated with each role that you want to have access to that area. We have an based upon channel list image below to see some of our recommendations in action. This example utilizes one channel category for all patrons, but gives certain patron tiers different levels of access. A Youall notice Patreon allows you to assign users multiple roles when they subscribe to a tier. This makes it handy to ensure your private channels categories are easier to manage across different role tiers. In our provided example youall see that all patrons have access to an exclusive general text voice channel to talk to each other regardless of tiers. However, different tier levels are given access to different additional perks such as sharing social media links for creator to follow back, polls for future content, a VIP text voice chat to better talk to creator theyare supporting. Conclusion Congratulations on launching your new and/or updated Patreon page! beauty of this system is that you can continue to create new roles channel permissions to best serve your community as you continue to grow. Now that youare done with basic steps outlined in this guide, all you have to do is edit/add/drop/shift roles around as needed to ensure you are making most of your Discord Rewards patron program. Patreon rewards give your fans supporters exclusives in exchange for supporting your work. Having this automated system to handle manage your supporters means you can spend more time making new content, less time worrying about a bot, a function in Discord whenever new patrons sign up. It also makes managing permissions much more simpler because you have a lot more control over which roles a patron is assigned to based on their subscription tier. Best Practices for Moderating Content Creation Creating an Area for Content Creators Content creation is one of coolest aspects of a community! Even those that do not create themselves can celebrate passion excitement that comes with sharing art. Artists shouldnat be regulated to just a generalized #media channel where all users are posting photos, you should consider instead giving them their own designated area in server. This shows these users that moderators see their contributions to community appreciate what they are doing. This area can be a channel dedicated to sharing art content, even an entire channel category depending on how your moderation team wishes to interact with your communityas creators how active this part of your community may be. Listen to their needs expand modify this category as necessary. Unique Rules of Road When building out a content creation realm in a server, it is important to keep in mind that your moderation team may encounter some new situations that don't apply to rest of server. Of course, content creators are subject to same laws of land in place for entire community, but there may need to be some of these unique rules of road to consider including: Plagiarism. This is practice of taking someone elseas work claiming that it is your own. Plagiarizing another content creator should not be tolerated within any creative space. It should be highly discouraged acted upon with moderator intervention if your community brings an accusation of plagiarism to your moderation team. As moderators, it is important to understand difference between plagiarism finding inspiration in someone elseas work. Tracing another creatorsa artwork is most common form of plagiarism, whereas being inspired by an original character to try out a new pose, color scheme, scene featuring them is inspiration. While creators are often looking out for each other willing to bring concerns about plagiarism to moderation teams, it is important to be able to look for it yourself by familiarizing yourself with your artistsa styles reverse image searching images of concern to your team. Be sure to be able to explain to your community why plagiarizing is harmful when these situations arise. Managing Constructive Criticism vs. Hate. Your content creation channels are going to be accessible to your entire server. This is so that entire fandom can celebrate together, but also to drive interest from users to support your content creators. This means that average user can come in comment on content. There is a line between constructive criticism hate. Watch out for it as moderators be prepared to intervene should anything cross line into attacks hate-filled commentary that would give content creation an unwelcoming atmosphere. Oftentimes in creative communities it is an unspoken rule that you should not give constructive criticism unless it is specifically asked for. average user may not realize this could accidentally offend an artist if theyare not aware of this. As a moderator, itas important to help artists understand constructive criticism when they ask for it while shielding them from trolls baseless hate. Sharing content can be intimidating, so it is especially important to ensure that content creation channels remain positive respectful environments. One way you can mitigate this issue is by making it clear in your rules that unless artist specifically asks for constructive criticism, that feedback of that nature is not allowed. Bumping. Art bumping may occur in an art channel where artists feel their content isnat easily viewed by enough people. This is essentially act of media getting bumped up in chat from other people sharing their media at same time from chatter about other works. An accusation of bumping usually comes up when a creator feels their art isnat being noticed, if they believe someone they do not have a good relationship with is intentionally bumping their work. In this case, itas important to defuse situation not allow any forms of bullying by de-escalating conflict. Maintaining an environment where users respect everyone's work is necessary for peace of mind of creators consumers alike. You can also consider building out a channel category instead of a single channel which would allow for a channel dedicated to posting art a separate one for discussion. You may contemplate a rule of not posting art within a certain time frame of another creator posting, but be cautioned that this can lead to over-moderation by your community. NSFW content. If your server allows Not Safe for Work content, it is important that you create a specific channel for it that can be marked as an NSFW channel separate from your regular content creation channels. In line with Discordas policies, this will not allow users under age of 18 to see this channel without agreeing to a prompt that says they are not a minor. It is also important to consider that implementation of an NSFW channel disqualifies you from being a A Partnered Verified Discord server. Make sure to keep expectations around SFW NSFW content creation in line with that of your entire server, offer to answer any questions in DMs if a creator thinks a piece may toe boundaries you enforce. Advertising Commissions. If you have a blanket ban on advertisement in your community, you may not want to make an exception to rule here. However, if you decide to allow advertising commissions in your server, you are allowing more commissions to flow to your creators. Do not allow other users to beg for free art try to guilt creators with open commissions into providing free content to them. It may be case that your moderation team will have to enforce boundaries if someone who commissions a creator within your community doesnat pay them revokes payment. Conversely, if a creator requires payment up front then does not deliver work doesnat refund commissioner, moderator intervention should occur to no longer allow them to accept commissions from other members. To be clear, you are not responsible for their financial disputes business transactions. Ultimately, creators should look into their specific payment provider website for policy information on fraud filing disputes, both of which are out of your control. Your job as a moderation team is protecting creators from scammers who make themselves known within your community. Youave created this space to cater to creators need them to know that users who take advantage of them creators who take advantage of users are not welcome here. Low Quality/Low Effort Art. Something your moderation team should consider is whether not you will be moderating low quality low effort art. Lower quality art has ability to potentially create a divide with more experienced artists diminish overall quality of your artistic channels. Expectedly, this is a very subjective divisive topic. Moderating alow qualitya alow efforta art can run risk of upsetting younger users creators that are at very beginning of learning how to create. When considering moderating low quality art, be sure to display empathy compassion to avoid coming off as inconsiderate rude. Be honest realistic in your descriptions requirements for these art spaces so that users may have a better idea as to what is isnat acceptable both content quality wise. Other ways to healthily promote higher quality artists is via potential role systems, automatic pins, weekly artist highlights, which will be discussed in further detail below. Off Topic Art. As a team, think about whether you want your artist channels to be dedicated to purpose of your server if you want to also allow off topic content. Once this rule is decided, check that your moderation team is on same page for enforcement nudging should you decide not to allow off topic art. Engaging Content Creators There are several ways to keep your communityas content creators engaged, which helps to showcase how much your moderation team values their contributions to server. Discord has several native features that can showcase your communityas talent in emojis, stickers, banners, server icons. While a banner a server icon are important to be branded thus rarely changed, generating emojis stickers (especially from within your community) is a good way to bond, celebrate inside jokes with your community, show some love for your creators. Oftentimes communities will employ certain yearly opportunities like emoji elections where creators can submit emojis for consideration allow your community to vote as a whole. Continued engagement with your content creators is also important. If you are engaging your community with generalized game server events, examine whether you can engage your content creators in same way with art events monthly prompts as this promotes community bonding. If your community has a system to reward winners for their work participation in events, work to instill same kind of system for art adjacent events prompts. Finally, some communities may want to install a special role for content creators, especially those that are active constantly contributing quality work. This will showcase artists in server to rest of server. Do keep in mind however, that unique role colors can lead to inadvertent exclusivity a social hierarchy within server. This can also have effect of alienating artists that do not yet have role, which is why you should be careful when thinking about if you want to introduce this role to your community. If you decide to bring a specialized role into your server, take step to have clear criteria for users to qualify for it as well as easy rules for moderators to grant it to users. This ensures that your moderation team can avoid accidentally leaving someone out hurting someoneas feelings. Avoid bringing a role into your server if your server has had problems with role related hierarchies in past. Listen to your communityas needs anticipate potential problems! Conclusion Content creators are an exciting subset of fandom that should be welcomed to your community! Ensure that they have their own area to share all forms of content in, whether it be a channel an entire channel category. Be aware that content creation arenas often come with unique rule considerations that you may not have encountered previously in daily moderation of your server. Talk to your moderation team about everything before launching this channel category so that you are all on same wavelength with enforcement before jumping in. Continuously engage your creators involve them in artistic aspects of server, such as emoji sticker creation. Art can bring people together, having a healthy artistic space within your community will provide a new way for your community to bond celebrate your fandom! Managing Interpersonal Relationships Degrees of Interpersonal Relationships Any relationship between two members of a community can be described as an interpersonal relationship. These relationships exist on a wide spectrum. As you participate in a community, you are most likely going to develop connections to varying degrees with other members of community. As a moderator, this may even be expected as part of your duties to promote community engagement healthy conversations. Thatas perfectly normal, as itas very natural for people who spend a lot of time communicating to develop closer ties to one another. Every kind of relationship, from mere acquaintances to romantic partners, can occur in a Discord community, every relationship you form as a moderator will carry its own unique challenges responsibilities in order to ensure you are performing your duties to best of your ability. Any kind of interpersonal relationship can create difficulty in moderation, but as nature of relationship changes, so too does unconscious bias you may experience. A friendship between a moderator a member of community is least problematic type of intersocial relationship, but as these friendships form it is still important to take notice be aware of them. As a moderator it is your duty to be available to everyone in community, even people who you may not ever see as a friend, so you must resist temptation to devote more time attention to people you more easily connect with. If your biases toward your friends begin to show up in your moderation efforts, many more serious harder to diagnose problems can arise. Feelings of ""elitism"" afavoritisma can start to take hold disgruntled members may take advantage of your friendships to excuse justify their own behavior, so take care to make sure that you are remaining impartial. A friendship between a moderator a member of community that persists for a long period can evolve into a closer more open relationship. These relationships are built on trust shared experience, can be more difficult to impartially manage than regular friendships acquaintances. This kind of relationship could come from fact that this person is someone you know from another server, in real life, possibly even a family member. No matter what scenario, closeness of this kind of relationship makes it very difficult, sometimes impossible, to remove your own partiality from equation. Special care must be taken to ensure you engage listen to other moderators on your team when someone you are closely involved with is in question. When in doubt, it may be best to remove yourself from situation entirely, which we will discuss in more detail later in article. A romantic relationship between a moderator a member of community can (and does!) happen. As is natural, if you meet someone who shares common interests has an attractive personality, over time your relationship may progress into something more profound. Romantic relationships are certainly most difficult to manage as a moderator. saying holds true, especially in new romantic relationships, that you will see your significant other through arose-tinted glassesa which tend to blind you from their potential flaws wrongdoings. Additionally, other members can very quickly see a budding relationship as an opportunity for a fellow member to grab power through moderator they are romantically involved with. As a best practice, you should remove yourself from any moderation decisions involving a user that you are in a romantic relationship with. Failing to do so can has directly caused death of some communities, especially when romantic partners are both on same moderator team. This type of one-sided interpersonal relationship is rare among moderators because of connection a moderation team usually has to content creator personality that they moderate for. More commonly, a user witnessing a friendly moderator carrying out their daily duties to interact with their server can develop such a relationship. However, this type of relationship requires an extra level of care awareness, as they can quickly become toxic if not managed appropriately. Always be aware of them, consider their existence when making certain moderation decisions. DMA has an article exclusively dedicated to parasocial relationships for further reading. On Visibility One thing to keep in mind when evaluating your relationships in your communities- regardless of nature of thema is that your relationships connections if played out in server are most likely visible to other members of community. When interacting with your friends, close friends, even your partner in a space with other people such as your server, members of community may pick up on fact that you do have these relationships. As with any kind of community, there may be feelings of exclusion perception of ain-groupsa that can arise in, especially when it comes to relationships between a aregulara server member a highly public visible one like a moderator. A responsibility you have as a moderator is to take this dynamic into account effects it can have on your members how they view you your friendships. Making sure that your friendships relationships are not creating an exclusionary atmosphere for other community members, where they feel like itas unwanted difficult for them to contribute. On subject of avisibilitya, a moderator a whether they are consistently conscious of it not - is someone in server who has power over other users in that space. It is not always easiest task balancing dynamic between being part of a community cultivating relationships friendships with being conscious of your role within that community as a moderator what that imbalance may influence. This difference in responsibility position can make relationships connections with other users in server more complicated. You may not be directly aware of it when youare chatting with fellow server members, but there will be users in your community who are keenly aware of your status as a moderator. This scrutiny can affect how they approach becoming friends with you as well as affect how they view your own relationships with other server members. Always keep this dynamic in mind be aware of how your position may affect not just how users interact with you but also how they interpret your relationships conversations with other members. A Higher Standard Just as it is natural for these relationships to form, it is also human nature to unconsciously develop act on a bias toward people closest to you. As a moderator, that natural bias is something you must actively resist, take conscious steps to avoid. What happens when friend of a moderator has a bad day doesnat act in spirit of rules of community? In an ideal scenario, moderatoras response would be same reasonable response that would be expected if offending member were anyone else. Your response to these situations will have a profound impact on your communityas attitude toward you as a moderator, as showing favoritism will quickly evaporate communityas trust in your ability to be impartial. Moderators are human, for inexperienced seasoned moderators alike, this kind of scenario can prove to be one of most significant tests of their ability to manage conflict. In preparing for this scenario, most important tool in a moderatoras arsenal is self-awareness. It is burden of a moderator that this commitment comes above any interpersonal relationships that may form during time spent engaging with a community. Being ever-mindful of your responsibility role in a community can help temper depth of relationships that you build. As a recommended best practice, moderators should be careful about building interpersonal relationships of depth (close romantic relationships) in communities they moderate, including with other moderators. only guaranteed way for a moderator to remain impartial in upholding rules for all members is to exclusively maintain friendships within their community, but this isnat always reasonable for communities that you are closely involved in. Should you find yourself in a difficult scenario involving a member with whom you have a close interpersonal relationship, here are some best practices for managing situation: first step in successfully managing a scenario that involves someone you have an interpersonal relationship with is to take stock of your own investment. How are you feeling? Are you calm capable of making rational judgment? Is your gut reaction to jump to defense of member? is opposite true - do you feel need to be overly harsh in order to compensate for potential bias? Carefully self-evaluate before proceeding with any action. wrong type of moderator response in a scenario like this can often exacerbate distract from actual issue at hand, potentially weaken your communityas trust in your capabilities as a moderator. If in course of your self-evaluation you realize that you cannot positively answer any all of these questions, it may be necessary for you to more seriously evaluate whether not you need to make difficult decisions regarding your position as a moderator. If your interpersonal relationship is preventing you from fulfilling your duties as a moderator, you may need to consider either abdicating your role as a moderator ending relationship until circumstances improve. Neither option is easy ideal, but making tough decisions for health of community is your primary responsibility as a moderator. Once youave determined that youare capable of proceeding with moderation, evaluate scenario to identify what problem is whether it immediately needs to be addressed. If there is no immediate need to step in, as a best practice it is usually better to defer to another moderator whenever your personal relationships are involved. Contact another member of your moderation team to get a second opinion some backup if necessary. If immediate action is required, a concise direct reference to rules is usually sufficient to defuse situation. Use your best judgment, but be aware that likelihood of arules lawyeringa is higher with someone who trusts you sees you as a friend in these scenarios because moderation action can be seen as a violation of that trust relationship. Clearly fairly indicating grounds for you speaking up is crucial to prevent further issues from arising. Additionally, be careful about what is discussed in private with person involved in this scenario following any action. There is a higher likelihood of them contacting you via DM to talk about your decisions because of level of trust that exists between you. As a best practice, it is usually best to avoid litigating rules of server with any member, especially a member with which you have an interpersonal relationship. Politely excuse yourself, if prudent, redirect conversation by giving member a place to productively resolve their own issue. As with any moderation action, once taken it is best practice to leave a note for your team about what action was taken why. Another period of self-evaluation is a good idea after any action is taken. Ask yourself, was action taken in alignment with rules of your community? Was it fair to both offending member, as well as other members of your community? Was your decision affected by your bias towards offending member? If necessary unclear, ask your teammates for their outside perspective. Summary Taking moderation action when offending member is one with whom a moderator has an interpersonal relationship can be one of most difficult scenarios that a moderator can find themselves in. Set yourself up for success as a moderator by tempering type of relationships you build within your community cultivating ability to self-evaluate. best tool available to a moderator in these scenarios is self-awareness ability to recognize when their own biases prevent them from acting fairly. Remember that moderation is a team sport, that team is your most valuable resource in impartially upholding rules values of your community. Considering Mental Health in Your Community Importance of Mental Health Awareness Before we discuss what to consider when introducing mental health channels to a community, it is important to understand difference between mental health a mental illness, to be aware of realities of what these terms entail. Mental health mental illness are strongly intertwined, but very different. People with good mental health can develop a mental illness, while those with no mental illness can have poor mental health. Mental health reflects our emotional, physiological, social well-being. Though topic of mental health is still quite taboo to talk about in certain circles, there is help available for those who wish to seek it. Mental health is a crucial aspect of a personas existence as it affects our actions, emotions, thoughts. A healthy mental state enhances effectiveness productivity in work, education, interpersonal relationships. A mental illness is a disorder of mind that affects not just our thinking but also our energy, mood, occasionally our conduct behavior. Such a diagnosis may make it difficult to cope with many obligations of life. Common mental illness diagnoses are anxiety disorders, such as panic attacks, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, specific types of fears. There are also mood disorders like depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia. An excellent guide for identifying mental health challenges pathways to care can be found here. Being informed aware about mental health issues is a great start when youare considering how it may affect apply to your community team. As an illness can manifest in a variety of different ways, it is vital to be ready have clear guidelines on these complex topics when dealing with online communities both for your staff internally for your community externally. An often overlooked result of community moderation is how it can affect mental health of your team. Moderator burnout stems from situations that harm your teamas mental health, understanding signs how to deal with it are essential in building a strong online community led by a moderation team that can act as a strong support system not only to your community, but to each other. Adding a Mental Health Channel in Your Server There is a lot to consider when discussing if you want to add a channel that addresses is dedicated to talking about topics that deal with mental health within your Discord server. Firstly, you have to determine whether not your community needs a mental health discussion channel thread. Consider whether not your team has seen much talk about mental health-related content in your community whether such conversations have remained respectful even without your teamas active intervention. If these conversations have devolved into arguments negativity in your community, maybe re-evaluate if you feel this type of channel will benefit those in your server really think about if you can find a way have enough resources to guarantee that it remains a safe space for all users. easy way to contemplate whether not a mental health channel would fit into your server is by looking at general topic of your server. If your Discord server is more focused on gaming, it may not make sense to allow something that drastically differs from your serveras purpose. Contrarily, a server focusing on community building might be a safer space for a mental health channel. Ultimately, itas very subjective all about listening to not just needs of your community but tone of your server. A lot goes into developing an excellent community introducing a mental health channel is not easy as you have to consider how to best moderate it. This includes how youall be utilizing auto moderation text filters in channel as accidental flags in highly emotional situations can be more harmful than helpful. If you do decide to create a mental health channel thread, it is important to be aware of all possible situations to be flexible prepared for unexpected scenarios. Understanding that some moderators arenat comfortable in these situations is important if you decide to allow such a channel on your server, you need to be able to vet your moderators future helpers. As moderators arenat mental health professionals, they shouldnat be treated as such should also be presented with option to opt out of spaces such as this. Therefore, it is vitally important that you establish clear internal guidelines procedures to set expectations for channel at a manageable level. Facilitating Healthy Discussions about Mental Health Discussing mental health in a positive way can be challenging as it is a sensitive topic with a variety of experiences attached to it. However, there are some ways to make this an easier experience from a moderation standpoint, most important of which is having clear server rules moderator guidelines for how to act when these discussions are taking place having clear escalation protocols for if things go south. Talking with your moderators about mental health challenging times in life as well as facilitating breaks for them demonstrates that you care about their well-being. This is an integral part of establishing a healthy environment for your moderators solid internal relationships. creation of specific mental health-related guidelines ensure that users remain respectful of each other that conversations are within designated guidelines of your community. Some suggestions for creating these guidelines include: Escalation protocols are another important foundation for when mental health discussions take place. Some ideas to consider when implementing them: a Moderation of mental health channels can be a touchy subject. On one hand, moderators should be firm in removing harassers users who are disrespecting others. On other hand, moderators should try their best not to over-moderate. There must be a balance to ensure that these channels that have very sensitive subject matters within them are moderated with care. Some ways to do this are: a There are an incredible amount of resources available for mental health supportaeverything from emergency phone numbers to suicide hotlines LGBTQ+ helplines. Find a Helpline resource consists of a list of global helplines hotlines. We also recommend looking at TWLOHA resource, which is a non-profit movement dedicated to presenting hope finding help for people struggling with their mental health. Discord has also partnered with Crisis Text Line, a non-profit that provides text-based volunteer support for people in crisis. You can learn more about our integration partnership how to use it on Discord here. Some more examples of support sites include: Not all communities are prepared to host a mental health channel thread, there is a lot to consider before adding one to your server. While allowing talk about mental health can be incredibly beneficial, it is just as important to realize that moderators arenat professionals should not be put in those positions if they arenat comfortable with it. Thatas why we advise that you carefully consider your current environment, your communityas purpose, implications that might occur if you choose to add one. Whatever you decide is best for your community, we believe that education is key. It may be helpful to think about adding a channel post that gives people access to professional support lines, such as FindaHelpline TWLOHA resource, as well as other resources laid out in this article. Generally, facilitating a healthy discussion around important topics of any kind is essential in helping to develop stronger communities online. Make sure that your community is a safe space for everyone that chooses to call it home! Twitch X Discord Is Discord for Twitch Necessary? At some point during their Twitch careers, most streamers will ask question, aIs having a Discord for my community necessary?a. Most streamers are already struggling enough with configuring their overlays, cultivating relationships with other streamers, taking time to edit design future content. Will working with yet-another platform really help move my streaming career forward, is it just another item on endless list of distractions? Most of streamers who ask this question fail to understand how Discord fits into their high-level plan for scaling their brand community. One of biggest misconceptions is that Twitch can be used for every step of growing your channel, brand, community. Twitch is only one of many platforms required for success. While Twitch is well-known for engaging monetizing your active community base, it struggles with content discovery, data collection, long term retention. Twitch should instead be viewed as a tool to engage connect with an already-existing community. image above categorizes content platforms into 3 primary groups; Discovery, Engagement, Activation. Content platforms that focus on Discovery are specifically designed to spread new, persistent content that can be viewed later. These platforms are ideal for finding new community members fans to engage with by inviting them to join another more personalized platform, such as a fansite, email list, Discord community. It is through this persistent community that you can advertise ways to support engage directly with primary content creators by supporting through Patreon viewing/subscribing on Twitch. platforms above can obviously be used for different purposes, but theyare segmented as such because of how their primary business models work. Discovery platforms run on ads focus on getting you to consume more content. Engagement platforms are more personalized, with content not designed for larger audiences frequently encourage users to take action. Activation platforms are designed to have monthly direct recurring payment models that provide an enhanced personalized version of Engagement content. Going Live Back Again With a better understanding of primary purposes of each platform, you can begin to design your user experience in a way that provides new community members an easy direct way to participate in show dedication to community. Regardless of how your Twitch viewers discover your channel content, directing them to a centralized community hub will allow them to share their appreciation with others, go from being an individual fan to being part of a community. To get most out of Discord encourage members to join your stream, spend time with your community before after each livestream. Before each stream, spend 15 minutes chatting with your active Discord members to ask them about their day receive feedback about your content. As you begin your stream, post announcements on your social media platforms use a bot to alert your Discord community that youave gone live. Moderators should continue to oversee discussions in your Discord, but encourage members to watch livestream as it occurs. Bots scripts can also be used to remind users to join Discord community if they havenat already, as well as following on social media for updates alerts. Finally, as your stream is ending, remind community that youall be available in Discord for a short time to discuss stream answer any questions. Some streamers will also include special events for high-ranking members subscribers, which can help encourage collaboration active use of server. Playing with Viewers via Discord One of most effective ways to engage directly with your community is to create content with them. This can either be done while livestreaming, else as a scheduled event that community can participate in. Events need not necessarily be games, but can also include Q&A sessions discussions about a topic of interest. Special precautions must be made while playing with viewers as youare live to prevent astream snipinga, where community members will attempt to disrupt your stream game while youare live. Moderators should take note be ready to handle disruptions while engaging directly with community, but most situations can be prevented by assigning restrictions requirements to be on stream with host. For example, being a subscriber to community requiring participants to apply for a spot if game has a limited number of participants can help ensure everybody understands follows rules. Discord for Twitch Checklist As you grow your Discord community, members will have different expectations of what your server offers, how itas managed what server is used for. For example, a community with 500 members may not be expected to have a full events calendar, but they would definitely expect that roles have been properly configured so that subscribers appear as a different username color with more permissions access to restricted channels. Below is a simple checklist for functionality your server should have: Conclusion We hope these guidelines have helped you to determine if creating a Discord server for your Twitch audience is right fit for you. most essential thing to keep in mind is that your Discord server is not just an appendix to your Twitch presence. It serves as its own entity community that needs to be fostered with same, if not more, personal attention care in order for it to blossom. With right mindset efforts, your Discord community can bolster your Twitch presence bring your community closer together, for longer Application of Metaphors in Moderation Five Types of Community Moderation Approaches An academic study interviewed dozens of moderators across multiple platforms grouped moderation approaches into five different categories: a Being able to understand perspective behind each of these approaches then applying them to your own community as needed is a powerful ability as a community manager. This article will discuss in more detail what these five categories mean how you can apply them within your own communities. Nurturing Supporting Communities Moderators that nurture support communities (nurturing-type moderators) focus on shaping community conversations that occur in server among members to match their vision. foundation for their moderation actions stem from their desire to keep community positive welcoming for everyone, not just long-time members. They seek to create a community with a good understanding of rules that can then develop itself in a positive way over time. These types of moderators may implement pre-screening of members content in their communities by implementing a verification gate using an automoderator to filter out low quality members content curate conversations of server to be better suited to their vision. Although this passive behind-the-scenes guidance is one type of nurturing moderator, these types of moderators also often actively engage with community as a aregular member.a For nurturing-type moderators, this engagement isnat meant specifically to provide an example of rule-following behavior, but rather to encourage high-quality conversations on server where members will naturally enjoy engaging with each other moderators as equals. They are leading by example. Overseeing Facilitating Communities While nurturing- supporting-type moderators operate based upon their long-term vision for a community, moderators that are focused on overseeing facilitating communities focus on short-term needs day-to-day interactions of community members. They are often involved in handling difficult scenarios fostering a healthy community. For example, these types of moderators will step in when there is conflict within community attempt to mediate between parties to resolve any misunderstandings restore A friendliness to server. Depending on issue, they may also refer to specific rules community knowledge to assign validity to one viewpoint to respectfully discredit behavior of another. In both situations, moderators will attempt to elicit agreement from those involved about their judgment resolve conflict to earn respect of their community members restore order to server. Those in overseeing facilitating communities category may also take less involved approaches towards maintaining healthy day-to-day interaction among members, such as quickly making decisions to mute, kick, ban someone that is causing an excessive amount of trouble rather than attempting to talk them down. They may also watch for bad behavior report it to other moderators to step in handle, allow community to self-regulate when possible rather than attempting to directly influence conversation. Fighting for Communities Where overseeing facilitating community moderators emphasize interactive communicative approaches to solving situations with community members, moderators who see themselves as fighting for communities heavily emphasize taking action content removal rather than moderating via a two-way interaction. They may see advocating for their community members as part of their job A want to defend community from those who would try to harm it. Oftentimes, moderators themselves may have been on receiving end of problematic behavior in past desire to keep others in their community from having to deal with same thing. This attitude is often driver behind their A no-nonsense approach to moderation while strictly enforcing communityas rules values, quickly working to remove hateful content users acting in bad faith. Moderators in this category are similar to subset of moderators that view moderation from overseeing facilitating communities, specifically ones that quickly remove those who are causing trouble. However, compared to perspective that misbehavior stems from immaturity, moderators that fight for communities have a stronger focus on content being posted in community, rather than intent behind it. In contrast to moderators in overseeing facilitating communities category, these moderators take a firmer stance in their moderation style do not worry about complaints from users who have broken rules. Instead they accept that pushback on difficult decisions they make is part of moderation process. Governing Regulating Communities Those that see themselves as governing regulating communities see moderation team as a form of governance place great emphasis on appropriate desirable application of community rules, often seeing process for making moderation decisions as similar to a court system making decisions based on a set of community alaws.a They may also see themselves as representatives of community moderation team emphasize need to create policies enforce rules that benefit community as a whole Moderators in this category may consciously run community according to specific government principles, such as having a vote on community changes. However, they may also achieve consensus within team about changes to server without involving community at large even have one moderator make final determination about community changes. This afinal decisiona power is usually exercised in terms of vetoing a proposed policy issuing a ruling on an issue that is particularly contentious within mod team community. Very rarely would a form of decision-making be exercised, it would be granted to very specific members of a team hierarchy such as server owner administrative lead. Even so, moderators in this category find following procedure to be important tend to involve others to some extent in making decisions about community rather than acting on their own. This tendency is also seen in way that they approach rule enforcement. Moderators that see themselves as governing regulating communities view rules as if they were laws of a country. They meticulously review situations that involve moderator intervention to determine which rule was broken how it was broken while referring to similar past cases to see how those were handled. These moderators also tend to interpret rules more strictly, according to aletter of law,a attempt to leave no room for argument while building their acasea against potential offending users. Managing Communities Moderators that see themselves as managing communities view moderation as a second job to be approached in a professional way. They pay particular attention to way they interact with other members of community moderation team as well as moderation teams of other communities, strive to represent team positively to their community members. This type of moderator may appear more often as communities become very large as there becomes a need for clearer, standard processes division of responsibility between moderators in order to handle workload. Though this metaphor focuses more on moderator team dynamics than relationships between moderators users, it can also shape way moderators approach interactions with users. Managing-type moderators are more likely to be able to point users toward written rules, guidelines, processes when they have questions. Managing-type moderators are also much less likely to make aon-the-flya decisions about new issues that come up. Instead, they will document issue post about it in proper place, such as a private moderator channel, so it can be discussed a new process can be created if needed. This approach also makes it easier to be transparent with users about decision making. When there are established, consistent processes in place for handling issues, users are less likely to feel that decisions are random arbitrary. Another strength of this approach is evident in efficient on-boarding processes. When a community has clear processes for documenting, discussing, handling different situations, adding new moderators to team is much easier because there is already a set of written instructions for how they should do their job. This professional approach to moderation can also help moderators when they are attempting to form partnerships make connections with other servers. An organized moderation team is much more likely to make a good impression with potential partners. If you want to learn more about managing moderation teams, click here. Conclusion As you read through this article, you may have found that some moderation category descriptions resonated with you more than others. more experience you have moderating, wider variety of moderation approaches youall implement. Rather than trying to find a single abesta approach from among these categories, itas better to consider your overall balance in using them how often you consider moderation issues from each perspective. For example, you can nurture support a community by controlling how members arrive at your server curating content of your informational channels to guide conversation, while also managing overseeing interactions of honest, well-intentioned community members quickly banning those who seek to actively harm your community. Itas perfectly natural that each person on your moderation team will have an approach that comes easier to them than others no category is superior to another. Making sure all moderation categories are represented in your moderation team helps to ensure a well-rounded staff that values differing opinions. Even just understanding each of these frameworks is an important component of maintaining a successful community. Now that you understand these different approaches, you can consciously apply them as needed so that your community can continue to thrive! Internationalization of a Community Expanding from one Language Which languages to choose entirely depend on type of server you run. For a community server, it is recommended to adjust it to communityas needs. Usually, most commonly featured languages outside of English are German, French, Spanish, Turkish Russian. You can determine your featured language by community analysis, server insights (if your server has them), demand. What nationalities are represented most in your server? Which users struggle most with English upon joining server if theyare struggling, what language do they usually communicate in? In addition to that, you can consider starting a survey every time you your staff feel ready to expand into a new language. On other hand, if you make a server for a brand company, it is recommended to go by your target audience. Introducing features like internationalization needs carefully planned, but steady steps. If your server was originally English only, itas not recommended to expand into too many languages at once for a variety of reasons. Agree on one language (preferably most popular one in your server) slowly add on from there, if need presents itself. Once you figure out a pattern a stable structure on how to approach expansion, you can add more sections for different languages. Server Design As your server grows, so does Discord. It is vital to keep in mind that your server can get a lot of incoming users who have never really used Discord before- so make sure your serveras design is user-friendly, easily accessible, has a clear structure. Also, remember that more languages you feature on your server, more text-and voice channels will appear for your staff. It is recommended to hoist most important text-channels at top of your server. That may include announcements, server-info, rules, optionally giveaways more. To ensure global accessibility, translate important parts like rules server information in every language you feature alongside your main language. Additionally, you can add a server guide for easier coordination. Both new users your staff will benefit from that. It should cover a list of accessible text voice channels as well as a short but detailed description of each. Furthermore, try to integrate every additional language in a way that utilizes it to its utmost potential. You can do so in form of a feedback suggestion channel in each languageas category. This lets you hear directly from users that would benefit from that additional language chat most. Consider having staff that are dedicated to interacting with each section instead of focusing all their attention on global chat. Having these additional language chats makes it so that your international users donat feel less validated only because they donat want to canat communicate in global chat. You can implement that same line of thinking when organizing server events. Consider alternating between server-wide international events as demand allows. For latter, analyze your serveras activity for each region host it at time with most community engagement for those users for best results. You can apply same system to voice channels by creating a few global voice chats then adding language specific channels. Your staff should only allow one common language to be spoken in global chats redirect every other language into their appropriate voice channels. Creating a Server with One More Languages From Scratch If you want to feature multiple languages with equal amounts, you can effectively combine multiple Discord servers in one. For first half, it will be same as before: Have at least one international general-chat before you split server into each language. That way every user is able to communicate with entirety of server instead of just their language-specific section. Let users choose their language via a reaction verification with option to opt-out change regions. You can summarise most important aspects in a common text-channel, text being translated into every featured language. simplest way to manage split server is by having same channels categories, but in different languages. This will heavily depend on type of server you moderate, but recommended channels for every section are ones you would usually include in a monolingual server. These channels should include things like rules, announcements, general-chat, bot-commands, media, optionally a looking-for-game channel, more. Take care to ensure you have appropriate translation for each channel. Moreover, community events can be a lot more diverse. You can host a variety of events for each language as well as let all of them participate in shared events. Take time to analyze each nationas activity also take holidays national days into account. Staff Arrangement Internationalizing your server may mean that your moderation team grows to be larger than expected, so to make it easy for users to contact appropriate staff you can separate moderators by nicknames, colors, role hoist. Nicknames: If you want to have moderation team equally displayed throughout server, you can arrange moderators by nicknames. Simply add language they moderate at beginning of their nickname so they are alphabetically sorted below each other. Users will have an easier time recognizing appropriate moderators, but with a large staff, this might end up looking a little busy. Some moderators tend to change their nicknames frequently may not be big fans of having tag in front of their name, either. Colors: It is advised to have colors of each moderator role in same shade with a slight but still visible difference. This helps to differentiate moderators regular users will be able to tell difference immediately. Remember that newer users might not check each role just contact first seemingly online moderator they see. Role hoist: If you display only accompanying moderator role for each language, ensure that you have a common, not displayed role for all moderators so one team is not less validated than other. Users should definitely be able to contact appropriate staff ping correct moderators to help them out with issues in chat. but, when displaying a lot of teams with many members each, some of them might be pushed off screen. You run risk that some moderators that are displayed below other teams seem less aimportant validateda to community, but shared staff role should fix that problem easily. Moderation While moderating a multilingual server it is crucial to have moderators that are native speakers at least fluent in each language that you decide to expand to. Having moderators that are native speakers makes it so that they not only understand textbook definitions of what is being said but understand cultural contexts that may come with international chats. However, these moderators should also be accomplished capable with other responsibilities of being a mod that lie outside of just being fluent. While community moderators should follow basic tasks (moderate chat, be accessible for questions, guide users), things in multilingual servers can be a bit more advanced. Moderators need to identify address inappropriate behavior towards other cultures in an authoritative, but instructive way. Furthermore, they need to free chat from toxic behavior control discussions about sensitive topics. In addition to that, they have to be open for cultural questions of users who chose a language they are not fluent in yet. Both user staff need to work their way around language barriers together. Theyall be required to help users, as well as resolve disputes, often at same time. For that, theyall have to rely on their communication skills in order to succeed in resolving both situations any other issue that may require it. Without good communication skills, users won't understand what you're trying to convey to them, which should be assertive but tolerant. Moderators can under no circumstances be discriminating towards users of other cultures beliefs. It is their responsibility to create a civil, welcoming comfortable environment for all users. While you are always entitled to your own opinion, make sure to keep a neutral output in public part of server try not to let it cloud your judgement. Managing several moderators from all around world can turn out to be quite tricky. Organizing meetings waiting for everyoneas approval for one date may be a real challenge to deal with. Getting majority of team on board could take days, especially with difference in time zones. One simple solution is to delegate some captains representative moderators for each team. They will gather feedback, opinions suggestions from rest of staff team discuss them with rest of staff during meeting. That way itas easier to organize staff meetings, but they can also directly inform rest of their team who could not make it due to time conflicts. Depending on size of staff teams, you can appoint more than one moderator for that position. When creating more than one staff role, make sure that everyone is comfortable with their position their responsibilities. Misalignment can lead to misunderstanding later on, it might create needless tension amongst staff. Consider appointing one representative in each region that your server is branching out to. That will open possibility to have regional staff meetings where language culture specific issues suggestions can be discussed without need for an international meeting with whole team. While not every moderator will get chance to get to know every other moderator from different regions in these larger moderation rosters, it is important that team feels united regardless. Donat leave it up to one team to tackle an issue- let them know that they can always ask for help from rest of staff. Global Accessibility: Make sure that you have bots available for every part of your server. That could either mean that you include them in global section of your server, you translate commands definitions in every language featured. Moderation: Since not all moderators will be able to understand every single language, using bots turn out to be very helpful for auto-moderation. Inform your fellow moderators about inappropriate words phrases ensure that you added them into bot filter for easier moderation. Banned filtered words should contain common slurs in not only English, but also in commonly banned words for every language that you offer. Language Barriers: It may occur that users message ModMail in poor English in their native language. Find out user's nationality reply with a message in their native language that lets them know their request is being routed to appropriately fluent mod. To save these messages, simply create an extra text-channel in ModMail server let moderators translate important phrases that might come in handy. Cultural Awareness It's easy for people to underestimate impact cultural differences can have. Culture influences values, rules, thought patterns, perception. That means that events happening in other countries may be viewed differently in each nation. News social media don't always portray truth which lets misinformation spread easily. Make sure to have your staff updated about current situations so they have it easier to deal with discussions about sensitive topics trolls. Communication is key users of server will massively benefit from it. While people are entitled to have their own opinion ask for further information, make sure to let it happen in a calm civil atmosphere under a moderatoras watch. If you as a moderator find that youare ill equipped to talk about topic, you should refrain from publicly voicing your opinion until youare better informed. Conversely, you may want to refrain from allowing contentious topics like current events politics to occur in your server at all, which is something you should decide with your moderation team as a whole. Final Words Making a server internationally available is a great idea can be a boon to your communityas retention. It can be utilized for both communities companies alike. But you have to be careful with your approach- Internationalization is a deliberate complicated process it should be treated as such. If itas gone about in wrong way, left uncompleted rushed, these international spaces could backfire. It may result in negative feedback, a disappointed community staff deserted channels. Make sure to inform your staff community about every step youare about to take, give them a chance to voice their input. Feedback suggestions from both your mods your community will be essential to making sure this is right fit for your server. Internationalization requires a lot of effort prioritization in order to properly take care of many factors simultaneously, but if done right, itas an unparalleled way to enrich your community. Training Onboarding New Moderators Training Methods Each server has to decide for themselves what most effective training method looks like. This article will present explain some recommended methods that can simplify moderation training. aBuddy Systema approach describes working in pairs groups, in which two more abuddiesa work together on one task. Requiring newer moderators to work with each other even an assigned team member allows you to better monitor progress for aid to come when required. It promotes active communication trust between moderators also allows them to keep an objective view on everything. Having multiple opinions about certain matters receiving assistance from a reliable source prevents moderators from feeling pressured with moderation tasks can even open your eyes to new viewpoints. Additionally, it allows its members to effectively share their moderation skills with each other. It also aids in terms of personal safety: if a moderator feels personally attacked by a user, they get immediate support from their abuddiesa without feeling need to tackle issue alone. A Using this system allows less experienced moderators to quickly effectively catch up to moderation standards as they learn how to deal with specific matters first hand. It is important to remind more experienced moderators on your team to allow new moderators to learn instead of wanting to quickly handle every task themselves. With time, certain actions will also become second nature for newer moderators, too! This approach is most commonly used when onboarding new moderators. Here experienced moderators head of staff introduce each new member of team personally guide them through most important aspects. difference between this system aBuddy Systema is that each new moderator will be acquainted with moderation tasks responsibilities by a higher up, usually only once. After walkthrough most recruits are expected to manage certain moderation duties on their own while being supervised. It is crucial to support reassure them so they are able to grow confident in their actions. Recruits can display appropriately train their soft skills be informed about moderation standards in a controlled environment without fear causing too much irreparable damage. Another method of efficiently training both experienced inexperienced moderators is by letting them regularly test their knowledge. This involves designing exemplary situations of some everyday issues happening within your Discord server to let trial moderators explain how they would handle them. Such instances can include how to handle issues in audio channels, user disputes, DM Discord invitations, off topic discussion in incorrect channel, potential issues that may be encountered with bots. At end you should provide some sort of amodela aexamplea answer to let recruits know where they need to improve. One negative effect of this system could be fear of failure that some inexperienced moderators might be exposed to. Reassure them that making mistakes is okay as long as you take responsibility for your actions are willing to learn from them. Moderation is an ever-shifting learned art, mistakes are not to be punished when they happen every once in a while.It may be tempting to conduct these regular exercises incognito (aka acting up on an alt to see how they do) test them without warning- while this may yield more aeverydaya unbiased results, it has a high probability of backfiring. Blindsiding your moderation team with tests exercises has potential to do more harm than good, especially in terms of team trust morale. Itas recommended that you donat do this instead, practice transparency when conducting regular exercises in order to avoid a potentially inequitable situation. Another form of training is to demonstrate how situations scenarios are handled in your community via presentation an actual demonstrative walk-through with moderation alt accounts. This is very useful for training where moderators have to use a wide range of commands, such as explaining moderation Modmail bots. Ideally, this should take place in an audio channel group call where you can share your screen. Not everyone is able comfortable joining a voice chat unmuting themselves, which is something to be considered beforehand. Training Program Content An essential part of onboarding new moderators is to have an easily accessible document outlining basic responsibilities details on moderator tasks different moderation teams. Such documents need to be designed for each server individually, but they usually contain general rules for staff, conduct expectations, a punishment outline to set a standard unity for moderation actions. Recommended additions to such a moderation handbook are: Be sure to recognize anything that is prevalent in your moderation culture community that is also worth mentioning here! more thorough guidelines, easier document is to refer back to for any questions. For example, gaming servers should have a brief description of featured gaming companyas Terms of Service discussion about how to handle cheaters users mentioning account sharing/selling in accordance with those rules. Another example would be for bot support servers where a brief description of commonly encountered issues how to solve them as well as an FAQ section to help users with simpler answers. Another important topic new moderators should have easy access to are commands for moderation bots. Having a simple guide in a separate text channel with a quick guide of botsa prefix format (command, user-id, [time], reason) will aid moderators in quickly responding to ongoing issues on server. It lets them react fast without having to pause to look up necessary command. Try to use same prefix for mainly used moderation bot to not cause unnecessary confusion, particularly for users who are new to moderating. Each server uses a differently designed service to assist moderators with helping out users. Bigger servers tend to rely on a ticket Modmail system, so properly introducing them with sample conversations problematic matters is essential for both recruit future user. Confident moderators are more willing to aid users in need than those who are still unsure of how system works. This kind of training should include commonly used commands procedures. There should be conversation about how to redirect users to higher staff closing tickets appropriately so they donat stack up cause confusion. As long as a ticket system remains organization those guidelines organizations are established across full team this will prove to be an easy to use communication system that is much less daunting than it may seem! Staff Safety No user should ever feel unsafe threatened on a Discord server. Staff members are often exposed to harmful disrespectful messages, some of them targeted at some moderators directly. An important aspect of onboarding moderators therefore is to make them aware of how to react in such situations. They need to be able to create an environment in which it is comfortable for them to work in not be afraid to ask for help if they feel threatened by users or, in extreme cases, other staff members. Staff members supporting each other being able to communicate in such moments is crucial for an effectively working team. Creating Managing a Training Program Effective management promotes a feeling of professionalism simplifies process of training new moderators by a lot. Important aspects that should always be covered when creating a training program are time management, deciding on which staff are involved in training why, effective communication, detailed content, flexibility. Choosing an appropriate approach. How do you want to introduce new members? What system did you conclude will work best for your server staff team? Never be afraid to evolve an already existing plan into something that suits better for your current situation. Deciding what topics to cover. What topics do you prioritize over others think require more time investment than others? How are you moderators handling learning process? Might there be anything in need of adjustment? Selecting voluntary participants. Having a reliable team behind you to assist you in training is of most importance. Everyone involved should be aware of what exactly they need to teach how to approach training within a reasonable time frame. Developing a timetable. Find common ground between everyone involved, including both mentors trainees, settle on when to teach what topic. Recommend tools to easily manage bigger teams are Google Docs similar, but bots self made timetables will suffice, too. Try to keep it simple easily accessible for everyone involved. Communication. Who responds to whom? Decide on how when mentors report to head of staff other higher ups. Documenting helps with ensuring everyone is aware of their part planning how to proceed further. Flexibility. No matter how carefully you plan everything out, it can always happen that something doesnat work according to plan. In such situations you need to be able to react spontaneously be flexible, such as pitching in for someone who is unable to attend due to a last minute shift in schedule. How to Deliver Effective Training Before conducting training, you should evaluate what can make your training most effective. Below you will find some best practices to set up a training program be able to atrain trainersa. Planning When you are giving a training, it is important to properly plan your training. What are most important topics to cover? What do you want new moderators to know after conducting training? How much time are you planning to spend on training? Some people struggle to focus for a longer period of time, so if your training takes over two hours, you should consider breaking your training up into multiple sessions of shorter duration. Make sure to accommodate for any accessibility issues notes for those who were unable to be present. Goals Each training should have objectives. You can create an outline of your training where you write down topics you will cover objective of that topic. For example, if you are training moderators to use Modmail, your objective is that new moderators are able to handle Modmail tickets use commands available to them. For each topic, also write down how you want to give this training: are you going to give a demonstration? Will you use illustrations? Will you offer new moderators to practice during your training get hands-on experience? Publicly sharing this with trainees can help keep you on topic allow them to come prepared with questions Practice After creating your training, make sure to practice it at least once. First, go through entire training yourself to see if everything is covered that you think is important. You can then give your training to someone on your team, in case you missed something important to check whether not your estimated time is accurate. If it is possible, go through material with someone who is unfamiliar with moderation. Adjust your training appropriately you are good to go! Interaction For every training session, it is very important to have interaction with your trainees. People lose their attention after 15-30 minutes, so your training should include a discussion, practice, some sort of interaction. Some of these interactive sessions are covered down below. Interaction with your trainees is also important because it acts as a way for you to verify whether not your objectives are properly conveyed. Make sure there is a break once every one to two hours so trainees can focus on your training without feeling overwhelmed. Methods Every training can consist of a combination of different training methods. These include, but are not limited to, lectures, quick exercises, group discussions, practice runs, quizzes, videos, demonstrations, more. When planning your training, you can write down what method would work best to convey objectives to your trainees. A group discussion will be better applicable to discuss moderation cases, where a demonstration practice would work better to demonstrate how Modmail bots work. Try mixing up multiple methods within a training to keep it fresh keep people from losing their attention. Preparation Preparation is key when you are giving any sort of training. Have quick notes ready with keywords that you are going to use during your training, so you do not lose track of where you are what objective you are trying to convey. If you need any material such as a presentation, paper pencil, example cases such, prepare them beforehand so you do not lose time during your training setting these up. If you use any material, test them beforehand. Donat forget to clear your schedule beforehand have some water ready if your training is mostly conducted over a voice chat call. It is important to sleep well night before feel confident. This will let you remain focused have an uninterrupted training session. Make sure you are ready at least five minutes before training starts to welcome arriving trainees as a final check whether not everything is ready good to go. If your training takes place in a voice chat call, test your microphone if you have a wireless headset, make sure it is charged up beforehand! Wrapping up your training When your training is done, finish with an exercise, group discussion, something else that is interactive fun to do. Ideally, this should summarize entire training. Have some room at end to answer any questions your trainees might have. Donat forget to thank everyone who participated for their active contributions! Evaluation After each training, write down what went well what could be improved. You can ask your trainees after they have had some experience as a moderator, what they missed during training that they think should be covered next time, as well as asking what information they did not find useful. You can then adjust your training for next time! Summary Having a training onboarding process in place is very important to have new moderators get accustomed with moderation culture, using bot commands, server rules, your moderation guidelines. There are several training methods that include buddy mentor systems as well as exercises demonstrations. A training document should outline most important information new moderators need, but prevent them from being overwhelmed with information they are unable to comprehend. To have efficient training in place, there are some very important aspects to consider, such as your preparation, goals, how you will carry out training of your new moderators, planning. Considering all of these things when creating your training process will make onboarding as informational effective as possible for you your new recruits! Reddit X Discord Does Your Subreddit Need a Discord? Discord communities are distinct from subreddits attract different audiences. While there are often overlaps between those audiences, it will not always be case, itas important to determine whether your community will benefit from having a Discord before you attempt to start one. Successful Discord communities revolve around human connections conversations not just content. For a Reddit community to translate well into a Discord community, it should be centered around a topic its members are passionate about are highly engaged with. To start, ask yourself following questions: If you believe answers to those questions would be negative about your community, it might be helpful to take a step back reconsider whether a Discord server would benefit it. Moderation Teams Typically, itas best to keep Reddit Discord moderation teams separate. Your Discord is a separate ecosystem with its own needs - itas important to find users from within it that will help you develop maintain it, make it flourish. When starting off, adding your existing subreddit moderator team usually works. However, itas important to note that those mods might not always be as dedicated to this new platform as they are to one that they came from. Looking into future for your Discord server, things might change subreddit mods that helped it in early days might end up having to take a backseat in favor of users who are brought in from within server. owner of server should be a dedicated mod from subreddit who knows both community inner-workings of Discord. Decisions made by owner will be critical to development of your server, so take a moment to review all of potential candidates within your team to choose best one for task. Make sure to bring in at least one user subreddit mod who is also as knowledgeable with Discord ecosystem familiar with your existing community to help with setup administration of server early on. You now have a bunch of mods! Mods on your subreddit, mods dedicated to your Discord server, mods that are both. But what do you do with all these mods, how do you tell them apart, what perms should they have? Communication between your different teams is key to success of both of your communities. Outside of owner, you should ideally have at least two other moderators that are present on both teams. These shared mods will be able to efficiently relay information between teams, coordinate collaborations between Reddit Discord communities, be able to take action in emergency situations, mediate conflicts if they occur. A Here are a few best practices: Itas important to be upfront to your community about fact that your subreddit Discord server are run moderated by completely separate mod teams after server starts taking shape. Set up escalation paths for both of your teams to direct issues related to your subreddit to Reddit modmail, vice-versa, direct users experiencing issues within server to its team. A All staff positions (except owner lead admins) should be independent of useras status on different moderation teams, you should remind your staff team that it is not a given to be modded elsewhere if you become a mod on either platform. Mods that participate in multiple teams must still uphold your activity requirements, meet all of your expectations similarly to rest of your team. Hosting Events Cross Promotions While your communities are linked together, theyare separate entities with different groups of regular visitors contributors. When considering cross platform promotions, assess their relevance to each of your audiences, determine whether they will find it helpful. A few best practices around this topic are: Closing notes Creating a Discord server can be a great way to broaden your subreddit-based community's horizons, giving your users a whole new way to interact with each other. However, it's important to remember that maintaining a Discord community can be a whole lot of work that some of your existing team members might not be interested in taking. Finding right person to lead your Discord ensuring your community's new outpost is in good hands early on will ensure a lasting smooth relationship between your subreddit Discord, to everyoneas benefit. Securing Your Discord Account Account Security first step towards securing server you moderate is securing your own Discord account. Your first line of defense is a strong unique password. Some characteristics of strong passwords include: You can also use a random password generator a password manager to create a completely random password that will be nearly impossible to guess, but difficult to remember. Another option is to combine several random words together. key, though, is that words need to be completely random. Using a tool to help select words at random from dictionary is a good way to help ensure their randomness. Once you have a strong password, you should also enable two-factor authentication, also known as 2FA. 2FA ensures that even if someone manages to guess your password, they wonat be able to get into your account without access to device where 2FA app is. You can also enable 2FA via SMS receive your authentication code via text message. However, SMS 2FA is less secure than application-based 2FA because text messages can be intercepted your phone number could be stolen. Although chance of this is still low, you should still avoid enabling SMS backup for this reason if possible. You also need to make sure devices where your Discord account is logged in device that has your 2FA app are physically secure. Make sure your computer is password protected locked when you are physically away from it. If you use a public computer, make sure that you use incognito mode on web browser to ensure that your Discord information is removed when you close browser. For a phone tablet, require a PIN code to unlock it so that it canat be used by strangers. Now that your account is nice secure, there is one more thing you must closely monitor to ensure it doesnat fall into wrong hands: yourself. Avoiding Social Engineering Attacks weakest link in any cybersecurity system is usually a human, security of your Discord account is no exception. Social engineering is use of deception to manipulate individuals into divulging confidential personal information that may be used for fraudulent purposes. People attempting to gain access to your Discord account may attempt to get you to log into a fake site, download a malicious file, click on a suspicious link. Being able to identify these actions avoiding potential pitfalls is an important part of keeping your account (and servers you moderate) safe. One of most common dangerous scams on Discord is a user a bot sending out a direct message with a QR code saying that you should scan QR code with Discordas QR code scanner for free nitro. This will generally be combined with instructions on how to access use Discordas QR code scanner. However, it is important to remember that Discord's QR code scanner is only used to log in to Discord. Scanning given QR code will allow that attacker to directly log into your account, bypassing your password any 2FA you may have configured. If you accidentally scan a suspicious QR code, you should immediately change your password as this will invalidate your current account token log you out of all devices.You can also report any such scams directly to Discord Trust Safety for further action. For more information on making reports, check out this article. Another common attack is to encourage you to click on a link that redirects to a fake Discord website. Before clicking on any links from a user, ask yourself following questions: If you find that answer to many of above questions is ayesa, you should avoid performing whatever action they are requesting. You can also check any suspicious-looking URLs with various URL checkers, such as this one. If user is specifically asking you to click on a link that prompts you to log in to Discord, another option you have is to navigate directly to https://discord.com in your web browser log in from there. If clicking on useras link still takes you to a login page, double check URL of website. One thing youall want to check is if website starts with https:// instead of http:, that there is a lock next to beginning of URL. Although some fake sites may still have an https:// designation, many of them will not. Other signs may be slight misspellings of URL visual tricks such as diiscrd.com dlscord.com with a lowercase ala instead of an aia. If you notice any of these signs, it is highly likely that it is not actually Discordas website instead a fake website intended to trick you into entering your login credentials so that it can steal your account. a Conclusion Creating a strong password, enabling 2FA, following best practices for physical device security are first steps towards keeping your Discord account secure. However, there may be people that try to trick you into giving access to your Discord account through various scams other social engineering attacks. Being able to spot suspicious messages users being cautious when encountering strange links files is another important part of keeping your account safe. Of course, anyone that is able to illicitly gain access to a moderator account on your server still has potential to do great harm, such as banning users deleting messages, channels, roles. Be sure to share this information with other moderators on your server so that you can each do your part to keep your community safe by keeping your accounts secure. Parasocial Relationships Definition A parasocial relationship describes a one-sided relationship between a spectator who develops a personal attachment through various influences to a performer who is not aware of existence of spectator. It is strengthened by continuous positive exposure to its source, which mainly happens on social platforms. Process In this section weall take a look at how parasocial relationships are developed how to establish severity of level of parasocial relationships you are encountering from a moderation standpoint. Development of Parasocial Relationships establishment of parasocial relationships can be portrayed as such: User A, in this example a popular content creator, uploads regular content on a big platform. User B, who takes position as a member of User Aas audience, takes an interest in their content. User B reacts to User Aas content observes them. While User A may know that people are enjoying their content, they are unlikely to be aware of every viewersa existence. This total awareness becomes more unlikely bigger audience gets. User B on other hand is regularly exposed to User Aas content takes a liking to them. interest is usually defined by User Aas online persona: content, visual appeal, likeability, even their voice can all be influencing aspects. User B perceives User A as very relatable through common interests behaviors starts to develop a feeling of loyalty, even responsibility, during that phase of one-sided bonding. This behavior can be attributed to personal reflection in User A, as well as psychological facts like loneliness, empathy, even low self-esteem. As a consequence, User B can easily be influenced by User A. At this point User B might feel like they understand User A in a way nobody else does may even begin to view them on a personal level as some sort of friend close relative. They see this individual every day, hear their voice on a regular basis, believe that they are connecting to them on a deep level. They develop an emotional attachment, stronger parasocial relationship gets, more attention User B pays to User Aas behavior mannerisms. While User A most likely doesnat know User B personally, User B will seek out interaction with recognition from User A. That behavior is typically represented through donations on stream, where User A either reads out their personal message name publishes a athank youa message on certain websites. Additionally, User B tries to follow engage with their idol on as many platforms as possible aside from their main source of content creation. These social media platforms are usually Instagram Twitter, but can also include User Aas Discord server. Levels of Parasocial Relationships While that type of relationship is natural sometimes even desired, it is important to define level of parasocial relationships differ between its intensity for safety of community, staff members, performer. In their article in Psychology focused academic journal aThe Psychologista, researchers Giles Maltby designed three levels of severity of parasocial relationships based on Celebrity Attitude Scale. aFans are attracted to a favourite celebrity because of their perceived ability to entertain to become a source of social interaction gossip. Items include aMy friends I like to discuss what my favourite celebrity has donea aLearning life story of my favourite celebrity is a lot of funa.a least harmful level is general public social presence. targeted celebrity is subjected to gossip mostly provides a source of entertainment. Their presence is mostly found in talks with friends, talk shows, on magazine covers, similar public-facing media. Discord users on this level usually interact with community in a relaxed, harmless way. next level is parasocial interaction. characteristics of this level are development of an emotional attachment of a spectator with a performer, resulting in intense feelings. This behavior is characterized by spectator wanting to get to know performer, followed by desire to be part of their life as well as considering them as part of their own life. A result of that can be addictive even obsessive behavior, which can be noticed in Discord servers, too. aThe intense-personal aspect of celebrity worship reflects intensive compulsive feelings about celebrity, akin to obsessional tendencies of fans often referred to in literature. Items include aMy favourite celebrity is practically perfect in every waya aI consider my favourite celebrity to be my soulmatea.a Spectators of that level usually ping performer message them privately in an attempt to be recognized. While that behavior is natural, anything that endangers safe interactions between themselves, community, performer needs to be supervised carefully. Unrestrained abusive behavior, which can be found in unwanted intimate, borderline NSFW questions comments, needs to be addressed corrected accordingly. final level is considered most intense level also most dangerous. It contains severe, harmful obsessions that can extend all way to stalking real-world consequences. Parasocial relationships to this degree will rarely be found on Discord, but have to immediately be reported if present. aThis dimension is typified by uncontrollable behaviours fantasies about their celebrities. Items include aI would gladly die in order to save life of my favourite celebritya aIf I walked through door of my favourite celebrityas house she he would be happy to see mea.a vast majority of users wonat reach level past seeing performer as a source of entertainment, but moderators should be aware of potential consequences of anything beyond that as they can be harmful to both spectator, performer, safe environment you are working to upkeep for all. Parasocial Relationships on Discord Parasocial relationships on Discord can pertain to anyone who is perceived as being popular influential, making them acelebritiesa of Discord. Some examples of parasocial relationships on Discord can be found between a user a moderator, a user a content creator you are moderating for, even a member of your moderation team content creator you are working for. But what does all that mean for you, mod? While Discord moderators are not nearly as popular influential as big content creators celebrities, they are still observed by Discord users. While being a moderator puts you into a position of power responsibility over wellbeing of server, some users perceive it as you climbing social ladder in Discord server. In their eyes, becoming a moderator changes your overall social status within your Discord community. Being hoisted higher in serversa hierarchy results in members quickly recognizing you potentially treating you differently due to your influence, even becoming afansa of you as a person. Some users will soak up any information they can get about you, especially if they realize that you have common interests. This may lead to development of a parasocial relationship between users you. Users you have never interacted with before might see you as a person they would get along with seek out your attention, leading to a one-sided relationship on their part. Having such an audience can be overwhelming at first. People will start to look up to you, younger users especially can easily be influenced by online personas. They might adapt to your behavior even copy your mannerisms. Knowing that, you should always be self-aware of your actions etiquette in public to promote a healthy, sustainable relationship with users. Receiving special attention from users can quickly influence spiral into developing an arrogant, entitled attitude. There is nothing wrong with being proud of your position accomplishments, but being overtly arrogant will influence a membersa behavior towards you. mindset of one user deciding a moderator is not being responsible can spread through community in negative ways. They might belittle you in front of new members give them feeling that you wonat be there to help them might not inform you of ongoing problems on server during a temporary absence of moderators in chat. A healthy user-moderator relationship is important to prevent stop ongoing raids as well as make moderators aware of a user misbehaving in chat. Additionally, itas important to be mindful that your perceived fame does not start to negatively influence your judgment. For example, you may find yourself giving special attention to those who seem to appreciate you while treating users that are indifferent towards your position as a moderator more harshly. It also causes dynamics within staff team to change as fellow moderators might start to perceive you differently if you begin to allow bias to seep into moderation. They may start to second guess your decisions, feel need to check up on your moderator actions, even lose trust in your capabilities. If you ever notice that you experience said effect, notice one of your fellow moderators is experiencing it letting it consume them, be supportive sort out negative changes. When confronting another moderator about it, make sure to do it through constructive criticism that doesnat seem like a personal attack. In spite of that, effects of parasocial relationships donat always have to be negative in nature. If users manage to build such a connection to a moderation team, general server atmosphere can grow positively. Users know what moderators like donat enjoy, which will lead them to behave in a way that appeals to staff usually abides by server rules. They will also be able to predict a moderatorsa reaction to certain behavior messages new people might use. As a result, they will attempt to correct users that are mildly misbehaving themselves without getting staff involved immediately in hopes of receiving positive feedback from staff. Naturally, moderators wonat be able to know of every single person that tries to appeal to them through those actions, but once they are aware that such things happen in certain text channels, it will give them opportunity to focus on other channels provide their assistance there. As mentioned before: In case of content creators who frequently upload videos, streams, other forms of media for their followers, chance of a parasocial phenomenon being developed can be even greater. This will only intensify by joining a creatorsa Discord server. This can be done under false assumption that there will be a higher chance of their messages being read noticed. Your responsibility as a moderator is to neither weaken that bond nor encourage it while providing security for users, staff, content creator. Let users interact in a controlled environment while maintaining privacy of content creator. Some users might even feel like content creator owes them some sort of recognition after long-term support, both through engagement donations. Such a demand can be intensified when theyare shown as ahighera in hierarchy through dedicated Discord roles, such as Patreon/Donator simple activity roles. In case of multiple people building a parasocial relationship with same content creator experiencing that phenomenon, they may see other active users even moderators as arivals.a They see content creator as a close friend in their eyes feel threatened that others, especially those that financially support content creator, perceive them same think they are even closer to them. During such moments, it is recommended to keep peace between users let them know that content creator appreciates every fan they have. While ones providing financial support are appreciated, every viewer is what makes creator as big as they are played a part in getting them to where they are today. Maybe it wonat only be user that feels closer to them by joining server. Many beginner moderators may also find themselves feeling as though they are above rest of community because their idol has entrusted them with power on their server. Being closer to them than most of users can easily fog your judgement; it is essential to prioritize being friendly respectful to users over these personal convictions. When adding moderators to your moderation team, it is important to keep an eye out for this kind of behavior to combat it, to hold your teammates accountable should you see this behavior begin to exhibit in one of your teammates. Making sure your entire team is on same page regarding your duties standing in community is essential to maintaining a healthy moderation environment. As a moderator for a Content Creator, this individual you may admire deeply has put their trust in you to keep their community safe. Falling into machinations of developing an unhealthy parasocial relationship with them directly interferes with your ability to do that, failing not only community but creator. In Conclusion Despite potential dangers from parasocial relationships, fact that they develop at all may indicate that you are doing a good job as a moderator. While positive attention appreciation are key factors to a healthy development, not everyone may like that sort of attention it is completely acceptable to tell your fellow moderators even users themselves about it. At one point you might feel like you reached your limit need a break from moderation managing parasocial relationships aimed at you those around you. Moderator burnout is very real, you should not hesitate to take a break when you need it. Users will view you, as a moderator, as a leader that helps guide your designated Discord server in right direction. As such, you will be a target for rude comments by users that have personal issues with server while simultaneously getting showered with affection by other users who are thankful for what you do for server. Never be afraid to ask for help rely on moderation team if things go too far for your personal boundaries comfort level, even if you are an experienced moderator. Establishing a healthy relationship with community is important, but being able to trust your fellow staff members is even more so. Nobody expects you to build an intimate relationship with every member, but knowing you can count on them their support is essential for team to function correctly. Transparency in Moderation Pros Cons of Transparency While there are certain abest practicesa when it comes to moderation transparency, there is no single system that is right for everyone. amount of transparency you need for your moderation system ultimately depends on your server rules, culture, vision. This article will explain pros cons of transparency ways that you can apply transparency to your moderation system. Though idea of moderation transparency is generally considered to be a good thing, it is important to understand that there are both pros cons to transparency in moderation. Some of these pros cons are described below. To help you understand how pros cons apply to transparency, consider an example in which a moderator publicly warns another user not to call someone a aretarda because it violates an existing aNo Slurs Alloweda rule. Moderation System Now that you are aware of some of pros cons of transparency in moderation, you must next understand components of moderation system so that you can consider ways in which these components can be made more less transparent. Broadly speaking, a moderation system can be split into following components: Transparency communication go hand-in-hand. more you communicate these components to relevant users server as a whole, more transparent your moderation system is. Implementing Transparency There are several ways to implement transparency in each of these components, each with their own pros cons. Each section here will establish ways in which a component can be made more less transparent a recommendation of appropriate level of transparency for each. However, please keep in mind that every serveras needs are different some of pros cons discussed may not apply to your server. It is always important to consider your specific community when it comes to implementing transparency. Your server rules are backbone of your moderation system. They describe how your members should conduct themselves what happens if they donat meet those expectations. In general though, your rules should be specific enough to ensure comprehension compliance without being overly wordy attempting to provide an exhaustive description of prohibited behaviors. For example, giving a couple of examples of NSFW content for a ano NSFW content rulea may help people understand what you interpret as being NSFW, compared to other servers Discord itself. However, too many examples may make list seem fully comprehensive, people will assume that items not on list are fair game. Disclaiming that examples of rule-breaking content are non-exhaustive that moderators have final say in interpreting if someone is breaking rules can help to address users that are interested in testing limits of rules being rules lawyers to escape punishment on a technicality. Developing moderator guidelines is another important part of your moderation system. Similar to your rules guiding conduct of your server members, your moderator guidelines help guide conduct of your moderators. Keeping your moderator guidelines visible to rest of server will encourage compliance from members, enable them to defuse incidents without moderator intervention. Furthermore, providing basic standards of moderator conduct will help users know when itas appropriate to report moderators to server owner for misconduct hold them accountable. However, you should avoid putting too much of your moderator guidelines out in public in order to avoid rules lawyers deliberately misinterpreting spirit of guidelines to their advantage. After developing your moderator guidelines, balancing these pros cons will help you determine how much of your guidelines you should present to public. Logging user infractions is key to ensuring that entire moderation team has same understanding of how often a user has broken rules. Transparency between mod team user in question is important for user to understand when they have received a warning that brings them closer to being banned from server. Informing user of which moderator warned them is important for holding moderators accountable to warnings they issue, but may leave moderators open to harassment by warned users. Having a procedure to deal with harassment that stems from this, is one way to achieve accountability while still protecting your moderators from bad actors in your server. Although communication of infractions is vital to ensure understanding among your server members, it may be prudent to withhold information about exactly how close a user is to being banned so that they do not attempt to toe line by staying just under threshold for being banned. Furthermore, even though a public infraction log may be a good way to promote cohesion transparency by showing examples of unacceptable behavior to rest of server fostering discussion between mod team community, others may think that such a log infringes on user privacy that these logs may constitute a awitch hunt.a It may also leave mods users open to harassment over warnings given received. If you want to encourage a sense of community understanding without taking away user privacy inadvertently encouraging harassment, a better option may be to encourage users to bring up criticisms of rules enforcement in a feedback channel if they wish to. Provided that mod team ensures these conversations remain constructive civil, creating a public medium for these conversations will help others understand how mod team operates allow them to provide feedback on how server is run. Everyone makes mistakes, moderators are no exception. It is important to have a process for users to appeal their warnings punishments if they feel that they were issued unfairly. If you decide to have a public infractions log, you may receive appeals on behalf of warned users from people who were uninvolved in situation if they feel warning was issued unfairly. While this can help with accountability if a user is too nervous to try to appeal their warning, it can also waste time of your mod team by involving someone that does not have a complete understanding of situation. In general, it is better to keep appeal process private between moderation team punished user, primarily via mediums such as direct messages with an administrator through a mod mail bot. During appeal process, it is best to ensure that you clearly calmly walk through situation with appealing user to help them better understand rules while maintaining moderator accountability. Summary In end, there is not a single acorrecta way to manage transparency in your moderation system. appropriate level of transparency will vary based on size of server rules that you implement. However, walking through steps of your moderation system one by one considering various pros cons of transparency will help you determine for yourself how to incorporate transparency into your moderation system. This will help you build trust between moderators non-moderators while preventing abuse on both ends of system. Auto Moderation in Discord Why is Auto Moderation important? Auto Moderation is integral to many communities on Discord, especially those of any notable size. There are many valid reasons for this, some of which you may find apply to your community as well. security that auto moderation can provide can give your users a much better experience in your community, make lives of your moderators easier prevent malicious users from doing damage to your community even joining your community. If youare a well established community, youall likely have a moderation team in place. You may wonder, why should I use auto moderation? I already have moderators! Auto moderation isnat a replacement for manual moderation, rather, it serves to enrich it. Your moderation team can continue to make informed decisions within your community while auto moderation serves to make that process easier for them by responding to common issues at any time more quickly than a real-life moderator can. Different communities will warrant varying levels of auto moderation. Itas important to be able to classify your community consider what level of auto moderation is most suitable to your communityas needs. Keep in mind that Discord does impose some additional guidelines depending on how you designate your community. Below are different kinds of communities their recommended auto moderation systems: If you run a Discord community with limited invites where every new member is known, auto moderation wonat be a critical function unless you have a significantly larger member count. Itas recommended to have at least some auto moderation however, namely text filters, anti-spam, Discordas AutoMod keyword filters. If you run a Discord community that is Discoverable has public invites where new members can come from just about anywhere, itas strongly recommended to have anti-spam text filters Discordas AutoMod keyword filters in place. Additionally, you should be implementing some level of member verification to facilitate server onboarding process. If your community is large, with several thousand members, anti-raid functionality may become necessary. Remember, auto moderation is configurable to your rules, as strict loose as they may be, so keep this principle in mind when deciding what level of automation works best for you. If your Discord community is Verified Partnered, you will need to adhere to additional guidelines to maintain that status. Auto moderation is recommended for these communities in order to feel confident that you can succinctly effectively enforce these guidelines at all times so consider using anti-spam text filters Discordas AutoMod keyword filters. If you have a Vanity URL your community is Discoverable, anti-raid is a must-have in order to protect your community from malicious actors. Built-in moderation features Some of most powerful tools in auto moderation come with your community are built directly into Discord. Located under Server Settings tab, you will find Moderation settings. This page houses some of strongest safety features that Discord has to natively offer. These settings can help secure your Discord community without elaborate setup of a third party bot involved. individual settings will be detailed below. AutoMod AutoMod is a new content moderation feature as of 2022, allowing those with aManage Servera aAdministratora permissions to set up keyword spam filters that can automatically trigger moderation actions such as blocking messages that contain specific keywords spam from being posted, logging flagged messages as alerts for you to review. This feature has a wide variety of uses within realm of auto moderation, allowing mods to automatically log malicious messages protect community members from harm exposure to undesirable spam words like slurs severe profanity. AutoModas abilities also extend to messages within threads, text-in-voice channels, Forum channels giving moderation teams peace of mind that they have AutoModas coverage across these message surfaces without having to worry about adding more manual moderation work by enabling these valuable features. Setting up AutoMod is very straightforward. First, make sure your server has Communities enabled. Then, navigate to your serveras settings click AutoMod tab. From there, youall find AutoMod can start setting up keyword spam filters.a Keyword Filtersa Keyword filters allow you to flag block messages containing specific words, characters, symbols from being posted. You can set up one aCommonly Flagged Wordsa filter, along with up to 3 custom keyword filters that allow you to enter a maximum of 1,000 keywords each, for a total of four keyword filters. When inserting keywords, you should separate each word with a comma like so: Bad, words, go, here. Matches for keywords are exact aware of whitespace. For example, keyword aTest Filtera will be triggered by atest filtera but not atestfiltera atesta. Do note that keywords also ignore capitalisation. To have AutoMod filter messages containing words that partially match your keywords, which is helpful for preventing users from circumventing your filters, you can modify your keywords with asterisk (*) wildcard character. This works as follows: Be careful with wildcards so as to not have AutoMod incorrectly flag words that are acceptable commonly used! AutoModas Commonly Flagged Words keyword filter comes equipped with three predefined wordlists that provide communities with convenient protection against commonly flagged words. There are three predefined categories of words available: Insults Slurs, Sexual Content, Severe Profanity. These wordlists will all share one rule, meaning theyall all have same response configured. These lists are maintained by Discord can help keep conversations in your Community consistent with Discord's Community Guidelines. This can be particularly helpful for Partnered Verified communities. a Both AutoModas commonly flagged word filters custom filters allow for exemptions in form of roles channels, with commonly flagged word filter also allowing for exemption of words from Discordas predefined wordlists. Anyone with these defined roles, sending messages within defined channels containing keywords from Discordas wordlists, will not trigger responses from AutoMod.This is notably useful for allowing moderators to bypass filters, allowing higher trusted users to send more unrestricted messages, tailoring commonly flagged wordlists to your communityas needs. As an example, you could prevent new users from sending Discord invites with a keyword filter of: *discord.gg/*, *discord.com/invites/* then give an exemption to moderators users who have a certain role, allowing them to send Discord invites. This could also be used to only allow sharing Discord invites in a specific channel. Thereas a lot of potential use cases for exemptions! Members with Manage Server Administrator permissions will always be exempt from all AutoMod filters. Bots webhooks are also exempt. Spam, by definition, is irrelevant unsolicited messages. AutoMod comes equipped with two spam filters that allow you to flag messages containing mention spam content spam. Mention spam is when users post messages containing excessive mentions for purpose of disrupting your server unnecessarily pinging others. AutoModas mention spam filter lets you flag block messages containing an excessive number of unique @role @user mentions. You define what is aexcessivea by setting a limit on number of unique mentions that a message may contain, up to 50. It is recommended to select ""Block message"" as an AutoMod response when it detects a message containing excessive mentions as this prevents notifications from being sent out to tagged users roles. This helps prevent your channels from being clogged up by disruptive messages containing mention spam during mass mention attempts mention raids, saves your members from annoyance of getting unnecessary notifications ghost pings. a This filter identifies spam at large by using a model that has been trained by messages that users have reported as spam to Discord. Enabling this filter is an effective way to block out a variety of messages that resemble spammy content reported by Discord users, identify spammers in your community that should be weeded out. However, this filter isnat perfect might not catch all forms of spam, such as DM spam, copy/pasta repeat messages. You can configure AutoModas keyword spam filters with following automatic responses when a message is flagged: This response will prevent a message containing a keyword spam from being sent entirely. Users will be notified with an ephemeral message when this happens, informing them community has blocked message from being sent. Discord will seamlessly block all messages containing matching keywords, spam content, excessive mentions from your filters from being sent entirely regardless of volume of messages, making this response especially effective for preventing de-escalating raids where raiders try to spam your channels with repeated messages excessive mentions. This response will send an alert containing who-what-where information of a flagged message to a logging channel of your choice. This message will preview what full caught message wouldave looked like, including full content. It also shows a pair of buttons at bottom of message, a Actions Report Issues. Thes action buttons will bring up a user context menu, allowing you to use any permissions you have to kick, ban time out member. message also displays channel message was attempted to be sent in filter that was triggered by message. In future, some auto-moderation bots may be able to detect these messages action users accordingly. a This response will automatically apply a time out penalty to a user, preventing them from interacting in server for duration of penalty. Affected users are unable to send messages, react to messages, join voice channels video calls during their timeout period. Keep in mind that they are able to see messages being sent during this period. To remove a timeout penalty, Moderators Admins can right-click on any offending useras name to bring up their Profile Context Menu select aRemove Timeout.a AutoMod is a very powerful tool that you can set up easily to reduce moderation work keep your community's channels conversations clean welcoming during all hours of day. For example, you may want to use three keyword filters; one to just block messages, one to just send alerts for messages, one to do both. Overall, it's recommended to have AutoMod block messages you wouldn't want community members to see. For example, high harm keywords such as slurs other extreme language should have AutoModas ablock messagea asend alertsa responses enabled. This will allow your moderation team to take action against undesirable messages users behind them while preventing rest of your community from exposure. Low harm keywords commonly spammed phrases can also have AutoModas aBlock messagea response enabled without need to set up alerts. This will still prevent undesirable messages from being sent without spamming your logs with alerts. You can also quickly configure AutoModas keyword spam filters in real-time to prevent de-escalate raids by adding spammed keywords - adjusting your mention limit in event of a mention raid - to prevent raids from causing lasting damage. It's also recommended to have AutoMod send you alerts for more subjective content that requires a closer look from your moderation team, rather than having them being blocked entirely. This will allow your moderation team to investigate flagged messages with additional context to ensure thereas nothing malicious going on. This is useful for keywords that can be commonly misrepresented, sent in a non-malicious context. a Verification Level None - This turns off verification for your community, meaning anyone can join immediately interact with your community. This is typically not recommended for public communities as anyone with malicious intent can immediately join wreak havoc. Low - This requires people joining your community to have a verified email which can help protect your community from laziest of malicious users while keeping everything simple for well-meaning users. This would be a good setting for a small, private community. Medium - This requires user to have a verified email address for their account to be at least 5 minutes old. This further protects your community by introducing a blocker for people creating accounts solely to cause problems. This would be a good setting for a moderately sized community small public community. High - This includes same protections as both medium low verification levels but also adds a 10 minute barrier between someone joining your community being able to interact. This can give you anyone else responsible for keeping things clean in your community time to respond to araidsa, large numbers of malicious users joining at once. For legitimate users, you can encourage them to do something with this 10 minute time period such as read rules familiarize themselves with informational channels to pass time until waiting period is over. This would be a good setting for a large public community. Highest - This requires a joining user to have a verified phone number in addition to above requirements. This setting can be bypassed by robust araidersa, but it takes additional effort. This would be a good setting for a private community where security is tantamount, a public community with custom verification. This requirement is one many normal Discord users wonat fill, by choice inability. Itas worth noting that Discordas phone verification disallows VoIP numbers to be abused. Explicit media content filter Not everyone on internet is sharing content with best intentions in mind. Discord provides a robust system to scan images embeds to make sure inappropriate images donat end up in your community. There are varying levels of scrutiny to explicit media content filter which are: Donat scan any media content - Nothing sent in your community will go through Discordas automagical image filter. This would be a good setting for a small, private community where only people you trust can post images, videos etc. Scan media content from users without a role - Self explanatory, this works well to stop new users from filling your community with unsavoury imagery. When combined with proper verification methods, this would be a good setting for a moderately sized private public community. Scan media content from all members - This setting makes sure everyone, regardless of their roles, isnat posting unsavoury things in your community. In general, we recommend this setting for ALL public facing communities. Once youave decided on base level of auto moderation you want for your community, itas time to look at extra levels of auto moderation bots can bring to table! next few sections are going to detail ways in which a bot can moderate. Bot-controlled Auto Moderation If you want to keep your chats clean clear of certain words, phrases, spam, mentions everything else that can be misused by malicious users youare going to need a little help from a robotic friend two. Examples of bots that are freely available are referenced below. If you decide to use several bots, you may need to juggle several moderation systems. When choosing a bot for auto moderation, you should also consider their capabilities for manual moderation (things like managing mutes, warns etc.). Find a bot with an infraction/punishment system you rest of your moderator team find to be most appropriate. All of bots listed in this article have a manual moderation system. main most pivotal forms of auto moderation are: Each of these subsets of auto moderation will be detailed below along with recommended configurations depending on your community. Itas important your auto moderation bot(s) of choice are adopting cutting edge of Discord API features, as this will allow them to provide better capabilities integrate more powerfully with Discord. Slash commands are especially important as youare able to configure which commands are usable on which bot on a case by case basis for each slash command. This will allow you to maintain very detailed moderation permissions for your moderation team. Bots that support more recent API features are generally also considered to be more actively developed, thus more reliable in regards to reacting to new threat vectors as well as able to adapt to new features on Discord. A severely outdated bot could react insufficiently to a high-harm situation. a As mentioned above, one of more recent features is Slash Commands. Slash commands are configurable per-command, per-role, per-channel. This allows you to designate moderation commands solely to your moderation team without relying on permissions on botas side to work perfectly. This is relevant because there have been documented examples in past of permissions being bypassed on a moderation botas permission checking, allowing normal users to execute moderation commands. a One of most common forms of auto moderation is anti-spam, a type of filter that can detect prevent various kinds of spam. Depending on what bot(s) youare using, this comes with various levels of configurability. One of most common forms of auto moderation is anti-spam, a type of filter that can detect prevent various kinds of spam. Depending on what bot(s) youare using, this comes with various levels of configurability. Anti-spam is integral to running a large private community, a public community. There are multiple types of spam a user can engage in, with some of most common forms listed in table above. These types of spam messages are also very typical of raids, especially Fast Messages Repeated Text. While spam can largely be defined as irrelevant unsolicited messages, nature of spam can vary greatly. However, vast majority of instances involve a user users sending lots of messages with same content with intent of disrupting your community. There are subsets of this spam that many anti-spam filters will be able to catch. For example, if any of following: Mentions, Links, Invites, Emoji Newline Text are spammed repeatedly in one message, spammed repeatedly across several messages, they will provoke most Repeated Text Fast Messages filters appropriately. Subset filters are still a good thing for your anti-spam filter to have as you may wish to punish more less harshly depending on spam. Notably, Emoji Links may warrant separate punishments. Spamming 10 links in a single message is inherently worse than having 10 emoji in a message. Anti-spam will only act on these things contextually, usually in an X in Y fashion where if a user sends, for example, ten links in five seconds, they will be punished to some degree. This could be ten links in one message, one link in ten messages. In this respect, some anti-spam filters can act simultaneously as Fast Messages Repeated Text filters. Sometimes, spam may happen too quickly a bot can fall behind. There are rate limits in place to stop bots from harming communities that can prevent deletion of individual messages if those messages are being sent too quickly. This can often happen in raids. As such, Fast Messages filters should prevent offenders from sending messages; this can be done via a mute, kick ban. If you want to protect your community from raids, please read on to Anti-Raid section of this article. Text filters allow you to control types of words and/or links that people are allowed to put in your community. Different bots will provide various ways to filter these things, keeping your chat nice clean. A text filter is a must for a well moderated community. Itas strongly recommended you use a bot that can filter text based on a banlist. A Banned words filter can catch links invites provided http:// https:// are added to word banlist (for all links) specific full site URLs to block individual websites. In addition, discord.gg can be added to a banlist to block ALL Discord invites. A Banned Words filter is integral to running a public community, especially for Partnered, Community, Verified servers who have additional content guidelines they must meet that a Banned Words filter can help with. Before configuring a filter, itas a good idea to work out what is isnat ok to say in your community, regardless of context. For example, racial slurs are generally unacceptable in almost all communities, regardless of context. Banned word filters often wonat account for context with an explicit banlist. For this reason, itas also important that a robust filter contains allowlisting options. For example, if you add acata to your filter someone says acatcha, they could get in trouble for using an otherwise acceptable word. Filter immunity may also be important to your community as there may be individuals who need to discuss use of banned words, namely members of a moderation team. There may also be channels that allow usage of otherwise banned words. For example, a serious channel dedicated to discussion of real world issues may require discussions about slurs other demeaning language, in this exception channel based Immunity is integral to allowing those conversations. Link filtering is important to communities where sharing links in agenerala chats isnat allowed, where there are specific channels dedicated to sharing that content. This can allow a community to remove links with an appropriate reprimand without treating that misstep with same gravity one would someone who used a slur. Allow/ban-listing templates for links are also a good idea to have. While many communities will use catch-all filters to make sure links stay in specific channels, some links will always be inherently unsavory. Being able to filter specific links is a good feature- with preset filters (like google filter provided by YAGPDB) coming in very handy for protecting your user base without requiring intricate setup on your behalf. However, it is recommended you configure a custom filter as a supplement, to ensure specific slurs, words, etc. that break rules of your community, arenat being said. Invite filtering is equally important in large public communities where users will attempt to raid, scam otherwise assault your community with links with intention of manipulating your user base where unsolicited self-promotion is potentially fruitful. Filtering allows these invites to be recognized instantly dealt with more harshly. Some bots may also allow by-community white/banlisting allowing you to control which communities are approved to share invites to which arenat. A good example of invite filtering usage would be something like a partners channel, where invites to other, closely linked, communities are shared. These communities should be added to an invite allowlist to prevent their deletion. Discord also implements a native filter on links files, though this filter is entirely client-side doesnat prevent malicious links files being sent. It does, however, warn users who attempt to click suspicious links download suspicious files (executables, archives etc.) prevents known malicious links from being clicked at all. While this doesnat remove offending content, shouldnat be relied on as auto moderation, it does prevent some cracks in your auto moderation from harming users. Raids, as defined earlier in this article, are mass-joins of users (often selfbots) with intent of damaging your community. Protecting your community from these raids can come in various forms. One method involves gating your server using a method detailed elsewhere in DMA. Raid detection means a bot can detect large number of users joining thatas typical of a raid, usually in an X in Y format. This feature is usually chained with Raid Prevention Damage Prevention to prevent detected raid from being effective, wherein raiding users will typically spam channels with unsavory messages. Raid-user detection is a system designed to detect users who are likely to be participating in a raid independently of quantity of frequency of new user joins. These systems typically look for users that were created recently have no profile picture, among other triggers depending on how elaborate system is. Raid prevention stops a raid from happening, either by Raid detection Raid-user detection. These countermeasures stop participants of a raid specifically from harming your community by preventing raiding users from accessing your community in first place, such as through kicks, bans, mutes of users that triggered detection. Damage prevention stops raiding users from causing any disruption via spam to your community by closing off certain aspects of it either from all new users, from everyone. These functions usually prevent messages from being sent read in public channels that new users will have access to. This differs from Raid Prevention as it doesnat specifically target remove new users in community. Raid anti-spam is an anti-spam system robust enough to prevent raiding usersa messages from disrupting channels via typical spam found in a raid. For an anti-spam system to fit this dynamic, it should be able to prevent Fast Messages Repeated Text. This is a subset of Damage Prevention. Raid cleanup commands are typically mass-message removal commands to clean up channels affected by spam as part of a raid, often aliased to aPurgea aPrunea.Built-in anti-raid It should be noted that Discord features built-in raid user bot detection, which is rather effective at preventing raids as before they happen. If you are logging member joins leaves, you can infer that Discord has taken action against shady accounts if time difference between join leave times is extremely small (such as between 0-5 seconds). However, you shouldnat rely solely on these systems if you run a large public community. Messages arenat only way potential evildoers can introduce unwanted content to your community. They can also manipulate their Discord username Nickname to be abusive. There are a few different ways a username can be abusive different bots offer different filters to prevent this. Username filtering is less important than other forms of auto moderation. When choosing which bot(s) to use for your auto moderation needs, this should typically be a later priority, since users with malicious usernames can just be nicknamed in order to hide their actual username. Specialized Auto Moderation Bots So far, weave covered general auto moderation bots with a wide toolset. However, there are some specialized bots that only cover one specific facet of auto moderation execute it especially well. A few examples descriptions are below: This bot detects raids as they happen globally, banning raiders from your community. This is especially notable as itall ban detected raiders from raids in other communities itas in as they join your community, making it significantly more effective than other anti-raid solutions that only pay attention to your community. Fish is designed to counter scamming links accounts, targeting patterns in joining users to prevent DM raids (Like normal raids, but members are directly messaged instead). These DM raids are typically phishing scams, which Fish also filters, deleting known phishing sites. Both of these bots are highly specialized link file moderation bots, effectively filtering adult sites, scamming sites other categories of sites as defined by your moderation team. Which bot do I use? When choosing a bot for auto moderation you should ensure it has an infraction/punishment system you your mod team are comfortable with as well as its features being whatas best suited for your community. Consider testing out several bots their compatibility with Discordas built-in auto moderation features to find what works best for your serveras needs. You should also keep in mind that list of bots in this article is not comprehensive - you can consider bots not listed here. world of Discord moderation bots is vast fascinating, we encourage you to do your own research! For largest of communities, itas recommended you employ everything Discord has to offer. You should use High Highest Verification level, all of Discordas AutoMod keyword filters a robust moderation bot like Gearbot Gaius. You should seriously consider additional bots like Fish, Beemo Safelink/Crosslink to aid in keeping your users safe have detailed Content Moderation filters. At this scale, you should seriously consider premium, self hosted, custom moderation bots to meet unique demands of your community. Itas recommended you use a bot with a robust diverse toolset, while simultaneously utilizing AutoModas commonly flagged word filters. You should use High Verification level to aid in preventing raids. If raiding isnat a large concern for your community, Gearbot Giselle are viable options. Your largest concerns in a community of this size is going to be anti-spam text filters meaning robust keyword filters are also highly recommended, with user filters as a good bonus. Beemo is generally recommended for any servers of this size. At this scale a self hosted, custom, premium bot may also be a viable option, but such bots arenat covered in this article. Itas recommended you use Fire, Gearbot, Bulbbot, AutoModerator Giselle. Mee6 Dyno are also viable options, however as theyare very large bots have been known to experience outages, leaving your community unprotected for large amounts of time. At this community size, youare likely not going to be largely concerned about anti-raid with anti-spam text filters being your main focus. Youall likely be able to get by just using AutoModas keyword filters commonly flagged words lists provided by Discord. User filters, at this size, are largely unneeded your Verification Level shouldnat need to be any higher than Medium. If your community is small private, likelihood of malicious users joining to wreak havoc is rather low. As such, you can choose a bot with general moderation features you like most use that for auto moderation. Any of bots listed in this article should serve this purpose. At this scale, you should be able to rely solely on AutoModas keyword filters. Your Verification Level is largely up to you at this scale depending on where you anticipate member growth coming from, with Medium being default recommended.

A webhook is sort of a areverse APIa: rather than an application you own (like a bot) calling another application to receive data when it wants it, a webhook is something you can give to someone else's application to send data to you directly as soon as thereas something to share. This makes process very convenient efficient for both providers users. Now letas apply this definition to a more tangible example. Letas say you arenat around to reply to new e-mails for a while. Through power of webhooks you could have a setup that replies automatically! When an event happens on a service (like receiving an email), that service activates your webhook sends you data relevant to event that happened. That way, you have exactly information you need to automatically reply to each new e-mail you receive. So what does this mean for your server? Basically, Discord provides you with ability to have a webhook that sends a message to your server when itas activated, with option to send message to any channel along with having a cool name avatar of your choice.For example, letas say youare waiting for latest chapter of your favorite webcomic series to release. You can set up a webhook thatas connected with an RSS feed. feed will activate webhook when chapter is released a message will be posted on your server to notify you about it. This can be applied to many different things - potential is limitless! If service is capable of sending JSON Webhooks, Discord can often use these to create visually appealing embeds when it sends a message out. However, it can also accept raw text messages to pass along as well. Usage of Webhooks Webhooks are a great tool for services that have events that youare interested in latching onto. This can be incredibly useful for Content Creator communities where their latest YouTube videos Twitter posts can be funneled into channels for followers to have easy viewing access in your Discord community. You could also use this for a community thatas oriented towards an open-source technology by having events from GitHub be submitted directly to your server for people to keep track of. There are a lot of platforms out there that provide you with ability to handle everything by yourself- from creating Webhook through your Discord Server Settings to plugging it into platform you want updates from. However, this often requires you to be more familiar with at least some level of programming as many of these platforms require developer accounts. There can be a few hoops to jump through to get everything set up just right. This can often turn people off from using these types of webhooks. However, times are changing barrier to entry when dabbling into world of webhooks is much lower. These days, multiple third-party services exist that have handled all hard techy stuff for you. They can interface with platforms that would normally require you to do extra work to get data you want. IFTTT Zapier are two such services that lets you plug-and-play several useful platforms directly into your Discord server through a clean web interface that allows you to customize type of data your webhook receives, thus what messages are sent to your server. Just keep in mind that some services have restrictions on how many events can be sent to one webhook, so you may have to create multiple distinct webhooks for multiple functionalities. Note that these options restrictions are entirely platform-dependent. Discord has no problems handling whatever data is thrown at its webhooks when activated, even if itas from different sources. Thereas another use-case for Webhooks that is more unique. While theyare very useful for automated messages, theyare also great for one-off embed messages that have a very polished look! You have ability to customize name avatar of webhook, but if youare technologically-inclined you can create your own JSON data to activate webhook with. This allows you to fully define aesthetics of an embed in your message, giving a clean look to whatever information youare sending. One possible application is nice formatting for your server rules information, rather than just sending multiple plain text messages.Of course, there are other possible uses, only limit is your creativity! If youare not too keen on developing JSON data by hand, have no idea what a aJSONa is, services like Discohook also make it easy for anyone to take advantage of this use case. As a note, websites linked here are not endorsed by Discord are only a suggestion from authors of article. How do I set up a webhook? process of setting up webhooks can be roughly explained in five simple steps! Step 1: In your Discord server, you will need to create a webhook copy webhook URL. This URL is path for your webhook to receive an HTTP POST request from a service when an event occurs. Step 2: From this menu, you have ability to style your webhook with a name avatar. We recommend at least a name to distinguish its purpose. Step 3: If youare using a third-party service to handle events send messages, plug your webhook URL into service configure type of events that service should trigger for. Step 4: If your third-party service allows you to, configure additional options that will change look content of your message to way you like. Step 5: Now that youave created connection, when event happens, data will be sent directly to Discord your webhook will post a message in your preferred channel! What is an Embed? Weave been talking about embeds a lot, but we havenat quite explained what they are yet! In simple terms, embedding refers to integration of links, images, GIFs, videos other forms of content into messages on social media. An embed itself is a part of message that visually represents content in order to increase engagement. As a user of Discord, you have probably seen embeds more than a few times. They often are created automatically by Discord when a user sends a link, such as allowing you to view a YouTube video within Discord when a YouTube URL is shared. But did you know that Discord Bots Webhooks can create their own embeds with all kinds of data? Theyare pretty flexible! They can have colored borders, images, text fields, other kinds of fancy properties. If you're a developer, options available to you to create a good-looking embed are powerful versatile. For non-developers, platforms may give you visualizations that help you plug-and-play data into a website for customization purposes. There are also online tools to help you do this too! Here are several of those properties that can be modified in an embed in order to style it, to give you an idea of whatas possible when you have ability to style your messages: Markdown is also supported in an embed. Here is an image to showcase an example of these properties: Example image to showcase elements of an embedAn important thing to note is that embeds also have their limitations, which are set by API. Here are some of most important ones you need to know:An important thing to note is that embeds also have their limitations, which are set by API. Here are some of most important ones you need to know: If you feel like experimenting even further you should take a look at full list of limitations provided by Discord here.Itas very important to keep in mind that when you are writing an embed, it should be in JSON format. Some bots even provide an embed visualizer within their dashboards. You can also use this embed visualizer tool which provides visualization for bot webhook embeds. a Benefits of using Webhooks There are several benefits to using webhooks in your community including simplicity, versatility, automation, customization, accessibility. Simplicity. Webhooks are straightforward lacking in complexity. They have a single function, which is to send a designated message when they are activated. Versatility. Webhooks have many different use cases, all stemming from being able to send a message upon activation. This allows for many types of automation powered by other services, allows you to send clean looking messages manually. Both of these setups have their own various uses ranging from posting updates logging to posting custom messages for an aesthetic purpose. Automation. With webhooks, there isnat a need to constantly look for updates post them yourself. Once set up, a webhook will automatically post any updates you need. Customization. Each webhook can have a unique name avatar, each message it sends can be unique as well. You can have multiple webhooks with different looks in different channels use each of them however you like. Accessibility. Once you create a webhook, all you need is its URL a website that will push messages. Since these webhooks are hosted on Discord, they donat need to be hosted like a normal bot, often saving moderation teams from encountering a financial investment to use them, making them more easily available to all users. Webhooks vs. Bots Webhooks bots, while having slight similarities, are actually very different from each other. There are several aspects we have to look at when comparing two: a Even though this comparison is important for better understanding of both bots webhooks, it does not mean you should limit yourself to only picking one other. Sometimes, bots webhooks work their best when working together. Itas not uncommon for bots to use webhooks for logging purposes to distinguish notable messages with a custom avatar name for that message. Both tools are essential for a server to function properly make for a powerful combination. a Even though this comparison is important for better understanding of both bots webhooks, it does not mean you should limit yourself to only picking one other.

Despite their limitations lack of functions compared to bots, theyare still very useful A play an important role in automation decoration of your server. Overall, webhooks are a great tool for pushing various messages, with limitless customization opportunities. Ultimately, choice of using them depends solely on your needs preferences. Internal Conflict Resolution Causes of Internal Conflicts There can be many causes for conflicts between your moderators, some of which occur more often than others. Some of these can easily be prevented, while others might need a more intentful thought process to stop them from escalating to a conflict. Personality Clashes Differences main reason for conflicts to arise is a difference in personalities amongst your team. Everyone perceives, analyzes responds differently to certain situations. While this should be a learning opportunity for everyone involved, it can lead to arguments when moderators can not get along. While emphasizing there are different approaches to same issue, you should teach moderators to learn from each other instead of disagreements ending in a conflict. When a moderator constantly disagrees with someone else, ends up in a personal argument, try taking them aside let them know that they should be working on their personal issues. You can help them as an objective observer - it can be very valuable to let members of your team know that you understand their individual perspectives are working to balance them. Try to avoid aHalo/Horns effecta as much as possible. This is a type of cognitive bias where your view of someoneas actions can influence how you think feel about that person in general, both positively as well as negatively. Poor Communication Misunderstandings between your moderators can lead to a conflict as well, especially when there is a different understanding of how a situation should be handled. Having transparent, consistent communication where everyone is on same page is very important in an online setting such as Discord. Text is often perceived differently than talking over voice even in person. Oftentimes a language barrier can lead to misinterpreting a message as well. Try to prevent misunderstandings from happening with clear communication when misunderstandings happen, step in where possible explain how situation should be handled. Foster a culture where it is not only allowed but encouraged to ask for clarification on someoneas statement if you have any doubts about what their intent was. Bullying Harassment Making jokes is beneficial for maintaining a healthy welcoming environment even a way to deal with tough situations moderators may face. However, it is important to make sure that jokes donat push boundaries of what is appropriate lead to perceived bullying of server members behind closed doors, even other members of your own team.What is perceived to be a harmless in-joke in context could out of context seem like a malicious unwarranted comment. When it is clear someone is not comfortable with certain jokes feels targeted, you need to step in clear situation by telling moderators involved that you want a positive atmosphere where everyone feels welcomed comfortable while clearly identifying what line was crossed so it does not happen again. Thatas not to say that all close knit groups trend towards exclusionary jokes, but it is something that can happen without a team even being cognizant that itas a problem. Hence why itas pertinent to keep inclusivity good faith intent in mind with situations like this. Unfair Treatment A main cause for conflicts is unfair treatment amongst members of your team. This might be because there is a lack of equal opportunities, because there are unrealistic expectations. Make sure that everyone on your team is treated equally as everyone deserves same treatment, regardless of your personal relationships. This also means you other moderators should have reasonable expectations of each other. Moderators often volunteer to help out in your community, so donat expect them to be available at all times; they might have other responsibilities as well. Any mod teamas north star should be that areal life comes firsta, to be lenient amongst themselves in face of that. Unclear Responsibilities Sometimes it is not clear what responsibilities everyone has on team. This can lead to misunderstandings eventually to conflicts. Make sure everyone on team receives adequate training information on what different roles positions should be doing. You might want to divide different responsibilities amongst members of your team between different roles, such as moderators administrators. Be as transparent clear as possible on what everyone should be doing. Competition Sometimes moderators feel that they are competing against each other, especially if there are statistics promotions available. You should always be clear that moderation is not about competition, it is about helping your community in best way possible. Not every moderator has same time available to help, so naturally there are going to be differences amongst your team. Moderation is not about quantity but quality - if this negatively skewed competitive atmosphere is a frequent issue, it may be worth looking at whether there are mechanisms within your community that encourage competition conflicts that could be removed revised, such as quotas, public moderation statistics, leaderboards. Different Values Standards Moderators usually come from all over world might have different values. Sometimes, these might result in a conflict. Remind your moderators that they should always respect each other's values, regardless of their own opinion. Moderators should be able to explain why they feel a certain way in order for others to be more understanding of situation. When someone has values that do not align with serveras moderation philosophy, you might need to remove them from your team. Unresolved Underlying Issues It is not always possible to immediately see a reason for a conflict, this might be due to unresolved underlying issues. It is very hard to know these without having a conversation with everyone involved. There can be many more causes for a dispute to arise, but it is always important to find underlying issue which causes a conflict, only then are you able to resolve it. Preventing Internal Conflicts To minimize prevent conflicts from happening, try as best as you can to get a comprehensive view of why how conflicts occur in your server. It is very important to develop interpersonal relationships with all of your moderators value their contributions to server. Encourage moderators to take initiative in projects they are enthusiastic about, especially in collaboration with other moderators. Just as moderators set a positive example in your community, you as leader of your moderation team should set a positive example within your team. When you propose major changes to server, listen to your teamas viewpoints before deploying explain why a decision was made. Good communication is very important within a team, not only to prevent conflicts, but also to keep all moderators on same page. All moderators should feel involved informed when you are making major changes. You can give your moderators regular feedback on how they are doing what they can improve. Make sure moderators always feel welcome to provide feedback constructively positively to each other that they can always contact you someone in charge in case a conflict does arise. Try to discourage gossip within your team, both internal external. When moderators start to talk about each other behind their backs, it becomes personal can distort relationship your moderators have how they see themselves within server. Instead, encourage moderators to form friendships with each other by organizing social events for your staff. During those events, you can learn about different personalities in your team. Last, but not least; you shouldnat lash out over mistakes.Give feedback where it is appropriate move on. Be quick to forgive forget. You should always prevent belittling your moderators while also creating a culture of de-escalating situations in private. Resolving an Internal Conflict There are many ways to resolve conflict internally most of these will depend on what cause is for conflict. A good way of resolving conflicts is using Thomas-Kilmann model. It should be stated that conflicts are not necessarily bad shouldnat be avoided at all costs. When you are working in a team, it is important to be able to challenge status quo question each other, to keep everyone on aligned up to date. In Thomas-Kilmann model, there are two dimensions when you are choosing a course of action: assertiveness cooperativeness. Assertiveness is degree to which you try to satisfy your own needs where cooperativeness is degree to which you try satisfy other person's concerns. Based on these dimensions, there are five ways to handle a conflict: All these different ways to handle a conflict are your intention to solve them: Sometimes situations occur differently than you expect at first. Donat jump to conclusions when you are dealing with a conflict, as reasons for conflicts are often more complex than they first appear. A Everyone tends to resolve conflicts in a certain way, so try to balance them so you donat end up overwhelmed overwhelm others. first step is to identify cause for conflict. You might already know this based on previously sent messages, but sometimes you need to contact everyone involved separately in private to determine cause of conflict. It is your responsibility to determine how to handle a situation. While collaborating together to resolve a conflict might look most appealing, this will not always be possible. Try not to completely avoid a conflict: if you feel uneasy dealing with conflicts donat want to give moderators feedback, you might not want to be in a leading position. If you need to resolve a conflict, choose a neutral place to work it out. This might be a separate server a private group. None of people involved in conflict should have power over others, so you someone else should act as an objective observer. If conflict is between other moderators, you should offer guidance, but donat offer solutions: ultimately it is up to others to resolve their conflicts, you are not taking sides. Remember that not all conflicts require consequences. Most conflicts are sparked by passion of your moderators who are simply in disagreement on how to deal with situations. Try to turn a conflict into a learning opportunity for everyone involved. Let them explain how they view situation how they would have handled it behaved differently. Afterwards, you should be able to identify specific disagreements that you can solve. Listen to everyone involved give everyone an equal opportunity to express themselves. Remind everyone to stay respectful at all times, even if they disagree with each other. Giving Receiving Feedback As said before, you should discourage gossip within your team encourage each other to give constructive feedback. It is important that everyone knows how to give receive feedback to prevent a conflict from happening in future situations. Giving Feedback When you notice a moderator that displays behavior takes action that can be improved, you should give them feedback on how to improve this in future. Donat rush in giving your feedback, everyone needs time to process. When a situation becomes heated, it will not be best time to give feedback. Remember to always give feedback in private! If you are in doubt as to whether not you should give feedback, see if you can recognize a pattern in their behavior actions. Everyone makes mistakes that is perfectly fine as mistakes serve as a learning opportunity you should only give them feedback if it becomes a pattern. Additionally, itas recommended that you ask for consent to give feedback. While this may seem a little counterintuitive to helping moderator improve change, blindsiding someone when theyare not ready can result in backlash rather than progress. When you do decide to give someone feedback, donat focus on person who made a mistake: focus on their behavior action instead.By making feedback personal equating it to an issue with individual rather than their choices, you can come off as argumentative unconstructive biased. Never exaggerate their behavior, be sure that you are clear specific . When you make generalized vague comments about someone, they will not be able to improve their behavior. Feedback should be actionable- there should be a suggestion a change that individual can work on as a result of feedback. Otherwise itas just airing your grievances, which is unproductive for all parties involved. next time you see someone doing something good when you have given them feedback in past, give them a compliment! Positive, specific feedback is especially effective in encouraging repeating said good actions. Giving each other positive feedback is just as important as giving each other constructive corrective feedback. Remember to always treat others as you would like to be treated yourself. It is proven that negative feedback is given mostly when people are experiencing negative emotions like hunger, anger, loneliness, tiredness. This negative feedback method is referred to as HALT-mode, it is important to try to avoid situations where you are giving feedback when you find yourself in one of these states. Receiving Feedback When someone is giving you feedback, it is very important to listen to what they have to say. Donat jump to conclusions, react defensively, disagree immediately. Take a moment to summarize feedback as you understand it to make sure you have understood their feedback correctly. You should always thank someone for giving them feedback, even if you disagree. It has to be clear you are welcoming feedback to improve. If you do not thank them, they might not give you valuable feedback in future. Ideally feedback is very clear specific, in which case you can end conversation by thanking them for their feedback reflect back what you are going to do with feedback in future. Other times it might not be understandable to you as a result, it is unclear what you should do differently in future. In this case you should ask questions to understand their feedback better. To have a better understanding of what they want to achieve with their feedback, it is a good idea to ask other person how they would have handled situation how they would have behaved. After this you should thank them reflect back on what you are going to do with their feedback. It is okay to let someone know why you disagree with their feedback, but remember to stay respectful at all times explain clearly why you disagree. Everyone should feel heard, even if you are not acting on their feedback. Handling Demotions There are many reasons why you might want to remove a moderator from your team, including internal conflicts you are unable to resolve. Removing demoting a moderator is not easy to do, but can be a necessary evil. Removing someone from your team should be in best interest of your community team can often be in best interest of that person as well. Be sure to give someone an opportunity to learn from their mistakes before removing them. Give a warning first have a conversation in private with them, following principles of giving receiving feedback outlined above. While it is not easy to deliver bad news, here are some tips to keep in mind when you do want to remove someone from your team. Donat delay conversation Once you have made decision to remove someone from your team, donat hesitate wait for conversation to take place. When someone is causing more issues than they are solving, they will need to be removed sooner than later, but make sure that someone has had enough opportunities to fix their mistakes resolve their issues. Please make sure you have this conversation in private, for example in direct messages a voice call. Keep it short clear When you are talking to someone you are removing, it is important to keep your message short clear. Tell them they are being removed from team, why you have made this decision, when this will take effect. Be transparent in what reasons you have for removing them, but do not go into too much detail with specific examples. This may result in a conversation where you are arguing about these examples rather than informing them of their removal. A Youare aiming for polite dismissal, not a lambasting of their character. Stick to your decision Despite your message being short, clear, transparent, you might still receive counter arguments as to why they should not be removed to give them another chance. It is important they can express themselves, but it should be clear at all times that decision to remove them has already been made is not up for debate. Always listen carefully to what someone has to say appreciate their feedback, but unless someone has substantial evidence a mistake was made, repeat your decision make it clear that your decision is final. Be helpful compassionate Even though you are delivering bad news, you should take a supportive approach in conversation. Remember that while it might be difficult for you to deliver bad news, it most definitely is difficult to be on receiving end. Show empathy for them especially when they have done a good job in past. In some cases, moderator youare removing may wish to receive feedback on what they can improve - giving this feedback in a constructive fashion is important, will help them to avoid future problems. This feedback should include reflecting on positive contributions they made to team, helping them understand what causes of conflict might have been while they were on your team, simply trying to give them something positive to take forward work on as a result of your conversation. This conversation shouldnat reflect a reversal of your decision, but can be a useful point of reference if they want to join other servers work on improving their skills down line, perhaps even re-apply to join team in future. Inform your team When someone has been removed from your team, make sure to inform team of this decision. It is up to you whether not you want to share reason for their removal, but refrain from sharing details as these are confidential, especially when these could be potentially harmful to someone. You also want to prevent anyone, including yourself, from talking bad about them, as this sets a wrong precedent for your team. As with your decision, you should be straightforward clear to your team, an example of this could be: aToday we have decided to remove Sarah from our team. I will not go into too much detail why this decision was made, but we believe it is best decision for community entire team.a In case someone was removed because of misbehavior, you might want to include that in message, as this gives team assurance you are not removing someone because of a personal conflict, it shows a strong message about how you want moderators to conduct themselves. Wrapping Up In every group, eventually a conflict dispute will arise which needs to be resolved. There are common causes, such as personality clashes differences, poor communication, unclear responsibilities, harassment. To minimize prevent conflicts from happening, try understand as much as possible why conflicts occur in your server. It is very important to develop interpersonal relationships with all of your moderators value their contributions to server. Try to discourage gossip within your team. When moderators start to talk about each other behind their backs, it becomes personal can distort relationship your moderators have how they see themselves within server. You can resolve conflicts using Thomas-Kilmann model. It is important to know conflicts are not necessarily bad shouldnat be avoided at all costs. When you are working in a team, it is important to be able to challenge status quo question each other, to keep everyone on same page sharp. When you want to give feedback to someone, talk to them in private be clear specific. Prevent giving feedback when you feel hungry, angry, lonely, tired. Focus on their behavior action instead never exaggerate their behavior. Oppositely, when someone is giving you feedback, it is very important to listen to what they have to say to avoid jumping to conclusions, reacting defensively, disagreeing immediately. Take a moment to summarize feedback to make sure you have understood their feedback correctly. Sometimes you need to remove someone from your staff team. Donat delay this conversation, keep it short clear, stick to your decision. When conversation is taking place, be helpful compassionate do not forget to inform your team as well, but make it clear that certain things remain private for safety privacy of those involved. Keeping all of those points in mind when managing a team environment will be integral to maintaining a healthy atmosphere full of various viewpoints that are united in shared desire to keep your community safe. Using Modmail Bots What are Modmail Bots? Before we discuss how to use a modmail bot, we should explore what they are what purpose they serve. Simply put, modmail bots are bots that allow users to contact moderators of a server via a direct message with bot. bot then relays these messages to entire moderation team by creating a private channel on server visible only to server moderators (also referred to as a aticketa). Moderators can then use this private channel to have bot relay their own messages back to original user, all while keeping a record of entire conversation within server. Moderators can even discuss ticket together in that channel without user seeing since it requires usage of a specific command to send a message to user. There are numerous modmail bots online, each with their own styles features. Some modmail bots can be self-hosted, while others are hosted publicly online! Here are some examples of modmail bots you can use: a It is important to do research into readily available bots to understand what your server needs to choose whichever one best meets those needs. Please note, content of this article is not endorsed by any developer company related to bots. What Can Modmail Contribute to my Server? Before adding a modmail bot into your server, you should determine if you need one by considering benefits drawbacks of modmail bots. Letas review pros cons of modmail bots to help with this decision. One of biggest benefits of having a modmail bot is better organization. Anytime a user opens a ticket, be it a question concern about server, instead of trying to figure out which moderator is online available, a user can quickly DM modmail bot get in contact with entire moderation team while also notifying active moderators online. This also eliminates over usage of pinging entire moderation team in public channels. a next benefit of modmail bots is team discussions. In above example, weare using ModMail bot by CHamburr. As you can see, a user has opened up a ticket that can be viewed by entire moderation team. team can then decide who wants to respond to ticket, as well as discuss ticket in question among themselves more efficiently handle issue. Team discussions are great for trickier questions that not everyone on team might know answer to. In image below, you can see an example of what moderators see from their side. team can split their focus knock out tickets depending on their priority, urgency, even work together to pick up a ticket if another mod has signed off. ability to read through moderator discussions work together is a great team building exercise for moderator teams! a a next benefit of modmail bots are information logs. Most modmail bots have a modmail log that shows all of modmail tickets that have been opened closed along with useful receipts of conversations that happened in channels. This is great for administrators/lead moderators who want to see how cases were handled want to catch up on what theyave missed while offline. This also helps moderators look back on reporting history if an old report is continued at a different period of time if they suspect someone is abusing modmail. Another benefit of having a modmail bot is anonymity. Some modmail bots allow you to reply to user anonymously which can decrease chances of someone harassing a moderator, other unpleasant situations that may come from having to action someone. Users can sometimes get upset want to seek revenge after being banned, muted, kicked from a server, so being able to communicate with someone action them without revealing your identity is extremely valuable. Moderators no longer need to act as amiddlemana between a user rest of team. moderator can speak on behalf of team use language such as awea instead of aIa which can communicate to user that it isnat just one person handling their case, but rather entire team while keeping their identity safe. a a Something that you will notice when moderating is that there are usually some questions concerns that come up frequently. Having a modmail bot can help you better understand what your community needs are better visualize what most frequent moderator tickets are about. With this knowledge, you can create custom quick-replies that you your team can use to more efficiently resolve tickets! Having same response to a scam DM that is used by all moderators on your server makes responding to those types of tickets quick, easy, consistent. Moderators can copy paste replies, use custom commands to reply with pre-made messages. Once you have set up quick replies, you can answer many tickets without needing to think of how to reply, making your replies consistent no matter who is responding to a ticket. Here are a few examples of situations you can make tailored custom-replies for ease, speed, consistency: It is important to know limitations drawbacks of modmail bots before deciding if your community needs one. Letas explore some of ways these bots can be abused, as well as other negatives you should know about. Please keep in mind that every modmail bot is different, so you can work to choose, even code, a modmail bot that may eliminate some of these drawbacks if you are concerned about them. Modmail bots are vulnerable to spam since anyone on server can DM bot to open up a ticket. Be it a targeted spam attack multiple users reporting same thing. Some modmail bots allow you to block a member from opening up future tickets. Depending on what kind of modmail bot you use, one drawback is that some modmail bots might not save conversations between you user who made ticket, only showing reason ticket was closed. Some modmail bots will save conversation, but not any comments made by other moderators regarding inquiry inside ticket channel which can erase a lot of discussion context from replies that are made. If you want to be able to track actions, you have to prioritize a bot that does save information logs. Another drawback is learning curve from using a new bot. Members that are new to Discord that arenat familiar with modmail bots can have trouble interacting using bot to report issues. Almost all modmail bots require a user to DM bot, which can go against initial instincts be challenging to new users. Some users have their DMs turned off which makes using a modmail bot more complicated if user canat receive DM replies from bot. One solution to this is to ping user in a public channel asking for them to change their DM settings so bot can communicate with them.Members figuring out a modmail bot for first time can lead to atesta messages which will spam your modmail tickets. While these arenat a big concern are mostly harmless, depending on size of your server, multiple users atestinga how bot works can lead to a lot of time cleaning up tickets. Similarly to how a modmail bot can be a learning curve for your members, a modmail bot can also be a learning curve for your moderation team. Learning how a modmail bot works can take some time to get used to if your team has never used one before. Depending on how familiar your team is with using bots, onboarding time may vary, so be sure to set aside time for learning teaching how to use a modmail bot. We have an article on Training Onboarding New Moderators that should help with this! Uses for Modmail Bots Modmail bots can be used in a variety of ways. They not only serve as a way to communicate with moderators, but also help with organization structure can be used for other purposes. Letas look at different uses of a modmail bot, how it can make life on server easier. aQuestions. Modmail bots help users who might have questions that they donat feel comfortable asking in public. This can be questions related to server, more private sensitive matters. By using a modmail bot, moderation team can efficiently answer question depending on who knows answer, user gets a sense of privacy by not having to ask in public. As mentioned previously, having a set of quick-replies to frequently asked questions makes responding to questions a breeze. Some modmail bots even have custom command replies where you can create commands to reply with a specific text, depending on command. For example, replying with command a=helloa can reply to ticket with a premade message meant to greet user open a conversation, such as: aHello. Thank you for contacting moderation team. How can we help you today?a aBug Reports. You can implement a modmail bot in a support server that deals with bug reports. Some larger communities have two serversaone for main community, one for support, depending on community product. Organizing bug reports using a modmail bot is an easy way to keep track of issues in one place. With ability to give a closing reason, you can later search modmail logs to look back at what sort of bugs were reported by different users. aBan Appeals. Anonymity is important when dealing with troublemakers online. One way to use a modmail bot is to have a ban appeal server for users who would like to re-enter your community after being banned. With this setup appeals go through modmail system so that banned users canat talk in any channels can only interact with staff team through bot. Moderators can then review appeal together reply to banned user anonymously through bot. Community Reports. Sometimes a member of your community needs to report something to moderators that isnat rule breaking has information regarding another user that is important for team to know. A modmail bot is great for relaying these types of reports to team so everyone is notified at same time without having to utilize an emergency ping. Server Feedback. Members of your server can provide feedback using a modmail bot. Using modmail for feedback removes need for a feedback channel guarantees that team will see feedback when it is sent. Staff Applications. There are different ways you can have staff applications for a server. Depending on who needs to see evaluate application, it can make sense to use a modmail bot to receive server staff applications in smaller arenas. When an application is made, a modmail ticket will open conveniently for moderators admins to look at. You can even comment within ticket to evaluate each application, case by case! Keep in mind that there are a limited number of channels (in this case, tickets) that can be made in a channel category so this will only work for smaller servers.The above list are just some of many common ways that modmail bots can be used to strengthen communication with your server. use cases for a modmail bot is limited only by your imagination type of bot youare using! Modmail Best Practices When using a modmail bot, it is important that your moderation team is on same page. Make sure there are clear protocols of how to handle tickets. An easy way to ensure that end-user doesnat get messages sent by multiple moderators is to have a moderator say that they will handle ticket inside ticket channel itself. This way, moderators arenat stepping on each otheras toes ticket can be handled efficiently. In image below, weare using a modmail bot that sends all messages sent in ticket to user, unless it has a specific command. Other modmail bots might only send a message to user if a reply command is used, so be sure to read bot documentation to know how your modmail bot handles communication between moderators user sending a ticket. a a Another good practice is to close any old resolved tickets as quickly as possible. If user has no further questions, it can be helpful to send a final message stating that if there are no further questions, ticket will be closed soon. This way, you reduce amount of open tickets maintain a clean organized modmail.As mentioned before, anonymity in responding to tickets can help reduce amount of harassment you your moderators may receive from rule-breakers. When using a modmail bot you can use discretion when deciding whether to respond anonymously with a more personalized response, depending on situation. Here are a few scenarios where itas okay to respond regularly: In most cases, however, it is better to respond anonymously especially when dealing with any modmail tickets related to actioning punishing another user. This applies to handling ban appeals if you have such a system set up. It isnat a big deal if you reply to a question without showing your name. same is not true if you show your name to someone who has been punished on your server.Each server has its own tone style when it comes to moderation. Some servers are more formal may have an official tone, while others might have a more relaxed easygoing tone. It is important to keep this in mind when responding to modmail tickets so that your tone in modmail responses is consistent with tone set by server. This article has explored ways modmail bots can strengthen how your team communicates with your community as well as direct advantages disadvantages that exist when introducing such a bot to your server. In some ways moderation becomes significantly easier, but in other ways, negatives like spam from these bots can be overwhelming introduce new problems to solve. Moderating a server can involve a lot of different moving parts it is important to analyze your communityas needs as it grows, taking into consideration whether a modmail bot is included in that growth. Use what youave learned in this article to make a decision thatas right for you your community.If you decide that a modmail bot isnat a good fit for your community, but you still want some bot help on your server, check out our Auto Moderation on Discord article! Managing Moderation Teams Getting to Know Your Team Above all else, foundation of a good moderation team is familiarity. By knowing your fellow moderators better, what they do, where they live, youall relate to them better. Youall get to know peopleas strengths weaknesses, learn to understand them better, get a feeling for when they need help, vice versa. Though you all may be in different time zones have diverse backgrounds youare all working towards same goal which is keeping community you all care for safe. Who knows- you might find that you share a lot of same interests along way, make great new friends, deepen existing friendships during your time together as moderators. Here are a few basic things you should do to familiarize with each other: Allocating Resources A moderation team needs a clear structure a unified understanding of server moderation, which has already been covered in Developing moderator guidelines. Now weare going to expand on how to utilize each every single moderator's abilities further. A moderation team can range from a few members in a small server to a huge team with 30 more staff depending on server size. bigger your community gets more team needs to be organized. While they are all moderators, it doesnat mean they all do same job. Some of your moderators, especially experienced moderators, are likely to be in more administrative positions. They usually stay further away from general day-to-day channel moderation while newer moderators are focused on watching conversations enforcing server rules. If you do have one of these larger mod teams, consider delegating certain moderators to tasks responsibilities that theyad be best suited for, rather than having a jack of all trades, master of none situation. This allows to divide team into smaller sub-teams that talk to each other more frequently in designated channels regarding their specific mod duties. Here are a few examples of sub-teams that are common within larger communities: Moderators that primarily contribute to community by enforcing rules, watching conversations, engaging members, solving member to member conflicts showing moderation presence. same type of moderators could also exist for Voice Channels, but that is mostly for very large communities. Moderators that are extremely familiar with permissions, bots, programming, etc. Ideally, they arenat just able to operate bots youare using, but also maintain them. A custom bot tailored to your community is always something to consider. Having a bot hosted ain-housea by a moderator within your team adds an additional layer of security. Bot Team is very valuable in making new creative ideas possible especially in automating day-to-day processes. Most servers host events, from community run events to events run by staff members. Event Supervisors watch over community members hosting events, watching out for new events, while being general point of communication in hosting announcing them. These are ways of how moderators can be utilized better by giving them a designated job depending on your team's size, also giving them ability to dive into certain topics of moderation more in-depth within your community, which overall makes managing coordinating a team as a whole easier. Decision Making As server size number of moderators increases, harder it becomes to hear every voice opinion. As a team, decisions need to be made together, they need to be consistent, equitable, take into account as many different opinions as possible. Itas important to establish a system, especially when making big decisions. Often, there are decisions that need to be done right at very moment. For example, when someone posts offensive content. In most cases, a moderator will act on their perception of rules punish offenders accordingly. At that very moment, offending content has to be removed, leaving little to no time to gather a few staff members make a decision together. This is where consistency comes into play. more your moderators share equal knowledge same mindset, more consistent moderation actions get. This is why itas important to have moderator guidelines a clear structure. Itas very important to give every moderator freedom so they donat have to ask every time before they can take action, but itas also important to hear out as many opinions on any major server changes as possible, if time allows it. Growth Over time, a moderation team grows. They grow in many ways, in their abilities, in number of moderators, but also grow together as a team. Every new moderation team will face challenges they need to overcome together every already established team will face new situations that they have to adapt to deal with. Itas important to give a moderator something to work towards. Mods should look forward to opportunities that will strengthen their capabilities as a moderator strengthen teamas performance as a whole. You should let moderators know that they have potential for growth in their future as a moderator. It can be something like specializing into specific topics of moderation, like introducing them into managing setting up bots. Perhaps over time they will progress to a senior moderator focus more on administrative side of things. Discord Mod Academy can be a valuable resource in encouraging moderator growth as well. While they may be familiar with some of concepts in Discord Moderation Academy, no moderator can know everything these articles have potential to further refine their moderation knowledge enhance their abilities. Professionalism Moderators are direct representatives of your community as such should be a reflection of what an ideal community member looks like. Many things tie into showing this professionalism, ranging from how moderators chat with members in public to consistency in moderator actions. presence of a moderator should never make people uncomfortable - there needs to be a fine line between aI can chat with this moderator like with any other membera aThis is a moderator I need to take what they're saying seriouslya. Here are a few attributes in what makes a moderation team look be professional: Your team should share positivity, engage conversation, show respect for others maintain a professional look. Make it clear to your moderation team that they are a highly visible perhaps incredibly scrutinized group within your community- to conduct themselves appropriately with those aspects in mind. Problem Solving As with all group efforts, there is a possibility for friction to occur within a moderation team. This is undoubtedly something that youare all going to have to address at some point in your mod teamas lifespan. Itas very important to deal with these situations as soon as they come up. Many people don't feel comfortable dealing with conflict directly as it can be uncomfortable. However, getting to any potential problems before they become serious can prevent more severe issues from cropping up in future. goal of a problem-solving process is to make a moderation team more conflict-friendly. As a general problem solving process, you should: With that in mind, there are also situations where youad want to exercise more discretion. Something that might prompt this is when a moderator makes a mistake. It can be both uncomfortable embarrassing to be acalled outa for something, so often enough best option is to speak to someone privately if you think theyave made a mistake. After moderator understands situation acknowledges mistake, problem can be talked about with rest of team, mainly to prevent situations like these in future. Still, sometimes there are situations where problems canat be solved things get more more heated, in end separating is unavoidable. Moderators leave on their own have to be removed. Your team members should always be given option to take a break from moderation- especially to avoid burnout. You can learn more about how to deal with moderator burnout here. Reviewing Taking a moment to look back at history progression of your community your mod team can be a useful way to evaluate where your team is at where it needs to be. time frame can be of your choosing, but some common intervals can be monthly, quarterly, half year. You donat always get to talk with your moderators every day - most of us volunteer, moderating as a hobby, having our own lives while living scattered all over world. With all of that going on it can be hard to find time space to discuss things that you might feel are lacking could be changed regarding server, thatas why reviewing is important. A Community Review can be done in many ways. For most, a channel asking a few basic questions, like how community has developed since last review, how activity growth has changed, is a good way to start. Most importantly, you want to hear how moderation team is doing. Talk about mistakes that have happened recently, how they can be prevented, review some of moderator actions that have been taken. A review allows everyone to share their thoughts, see what everyone is up to, deal with more long term issues. It also allows giving your moderators feedback on their performance. Summary essence of managing a moderation team is to be open-minded, communicate to listen to each other. Endeavor to manage decisions confront problems in an understanding, calm, professional way. Give moderators opportunity to grow, designated tasks, but also time to review, break rest. Remember, youare in this together! Protecting Against Scams on Discord Internet Safety Checklist Internet Safety doesnat have to be exhausting. Below are some simple but effective ways to make sure youare on guard against any potential neaer-do-wells in your DMs, even outside of Discord. Only Open Trusted Links from Those You Know This may feel like a given, but a surprising amount of security issues stem from people clicking on links before checking if theyare real deal. Always double-check a link youare clicking a link shortening services can easily mask unsafe websites programs. We recommend getting it checked against a resource like VirusTotal to see if someone has already flagged it as potentially dangerous. In addition, Discord has its own systems in place to remove malicious links weare constantly evolving those systems. Donat Download Programs Run Code You Donat Recognize Itas not advised to download run software that doesnat come from a reputable source. Downloading running programs that someone sends you unprompted is almost always a bad idea.If a person claiming to have aspecial access to featuresa new software says they need you to run on your own computer, theyare misleading you in order to get your personal info with their shady programs. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Never Give Your Password to Anyone Thereas no reason to give it up, ever. Sharing your password not only gives away access to your account but also exposes any personal information you have tied to that account a potentially any website where you use that password a making you vulnerable to more than just a single account takeover. Discord Safety Checklist above tips can be applied anywhere on internet! Next, we'll share some Discord-specific tips to ensure you can be vigilant against baddies targeting your account community: Decide Who Can Canat Send You DMs Disabling DMs for a particular server is one of best ways to prevent bad apples hiding inside larger communities from contacting you. To adjust who can canat DM you, head into User Settings > Privacy & Safety, then scroll down to aServer Privacy Defaults.a From there, youall find option to aAllow direct messages from server members.a Feel free to adjust it as you wish, but do note that this new state only applies to servers joined after changing toggle; it wonat retroactively affect your existing servers. If you turn this option off, members of newly-joined servers canat contact you via DM unless youare friends with them beforehand. Receiving mail might be nice, but receiving suspicious messages from people you donat know is less nice. If you're in a server you trust donat mind being messaged by those in it, you can toggle privacy setting on an individual basis. Head to that server on desktop mobile select its name to open server's settings, choose aPrivacy Settings.a Once there, youall find aAllow direct messages from server members"" option. Turn that on, youare free to receive all sorts of DMs from everyone in that server, regardless of if youare friends not! If youave joined a lot of communities, consider auditing list see if youare comfortable with letting non-friends message you from that server, if opening up is inviting unnecessary risk into your inbox. Audit your Serveras Permissions Understanding which permissions your mods members have access to is key to keeping everyone within it safe. If you're a server owner, have you checked your permissions list lately? Who has what perms? Did you know they had that access for how long? If answer to any of these questions was a resounding :shrug_emoji:, itas time to do a review of your server setup to ensure that only those who really need powerful permissions have them. Specifically, make sure that only moderators you trust have access to permissions that can change powerful server tools, including any bots webhooks you might add to server. Be vigilant for bots that are impersonating larger well-known bots. In almost every case, any large reputable moderation bot will never need admin permissions to work properly. Only give a bot permissions required for tasks you need no more a look for a Verified checkmark on a well-known bot before adding it. If you need a refresher on how permissions on Discord work, you can check out Help Center article here. If you have a basic understanding of permissions system want a more comprehensive look at what they mean in a moderation sense, we also have this article from Discord Moderation Academy. Keep Invite Links Updated If you update your serveras links, make sure that your community potential newcomers are aware of changes update any social media pages where you shared them. If possible, delete references to old invite links make it known that those links have been updated. This is doubly-so for servers Partnered, Verified Level 3-boosted servers that utilize a vanity URL: if your server loses changes its custom invite link, nefarious communities may swoop in claim your old one. If this happens before you update your public-facing invites, people trying to join your community may instead join a server thatas looking to cause trouble. A In addition to updating existing links, consider implementing easy-to-follow community rules around invite sharing encouraging members to always verify where a server invite leads who it is coming from before clicking it. Pro Tip: Try pasting one of those invites to a Discord message to preview where it leads to before opening it! (But of course, donat make your invite testing look like a spam message by pasting a random invite in #general.) Why Would Someone Want Access to My Account? If someone gains control of your Discord account, they will have as much reign over your account as you do: Theyall have ability to change your username, password, email tied to account, any other information associated with your account. Theyall also be able to see any personal info associated with your account once theyare in it. While most consider apersonal infoa to be payment info email, it can also contain your private conversations messages in DMs servers alike. If you can see it, theyall be able to see it. As if they were new owner of any servers you own, theyall be able to make any changes they want: from server layout to server permissions, to bots webhooks to kicking everyone out of server, you name it. If your account is moderator of a server that a hacker is targeting, they might even use you as a stepping stone to cause further damage within community, even impersonate you to trick unsuspecting members. Some users may also target Discord accounts that have unique profile badges that are no longer available, such as Early Supporter Early Verified Bot Developer badges. If you have one of these unique badges, you should be extra-vigilant with your account. If your account is taken over hacker changes password, there isnat much you can immediately do to stop them. However, if you have 2-Factor Authentication enabled on your account, hacker will also be required to provide a 2FA code to change your password. We strongly recommend enabling 2FA, you can learn how in our 2FA blog post. Reporting what happened to Discord can help you regain ownership of your account, which can be done here a let us help you! Additional Reading: Common Scams Weave created an additional blog post describing types of scams floating around on Discord, which you can check out to familiarize yourself with signs that you may be dealing with a hacker who needs to be blocked: Common Scams What to Look Out For We recommend sharing it with larger communities that may benefit from this knowledge. With these recommendations in your pocket, youall be better able to foil any potential digital threats. Just like with keeping your IRL-self healthy whole, taking preventative measures can keep your virtual self safe secure. Stay safe out there! Scams What to Look out for Fake Games, Programs, Videos Downloads In this situation, a user pretending to be your friend, using a friendas compromised account, reaches out asking you to check out their video, test a game they made, practice running code they wrote. No matter backstory, theyall always ask you to download a program click a link they provide, resulting in a malicious program entering your computer and/or compromising your account. Another variation of this scheme involves a user asking you to atesta something for them, directing you to open developer tools on your internet browser while logged into web app. Theyall then ask you to show them your token a do not do this. With your token, malicious users can sign in take over your account. Discord will never ask you for your token, you should never have any reason to open Discordas Developer Console in first place. Note that this is only applicable to Discord on your internet browser, not desktop mobile application. a Fake Giveaways/NFT Drops This is similar to previous scheme in that usually it is, again, a trusted individual that DMs you. Sometimes it's in form of a well-known bot under facade that they are an administrator for a server that you're active in. It may involve very genuine-looking links to websites as well. Like we said, if it's too good to be true, it likely is. Discord Impersonation for Partner/Verified/HypeSquad Discord impersonation involves a hacker pretends to be messaging you from an aofficial Discord accounta offer entry to one of our community initiatives, such as HypeSquad Partner programs. This is nearly always fake. Below are two screenshots, both of which present themselves as official Discord-sent messages. However, of these two conversations, only right screenshot is actually from Discord. On right, you can note blurple aSystema tag next to senderas name, as well as Reply space being replaced with a unique banner that only official system messages come with. DM on left does its best to be convincing though. It even sends an invite link to a real Discord-run server called Discord Testers a somewhat-real-looking link to supposed Discord Hypesquad form. Scammers will use a technique of mixing real Discord invite links (to public Discord servers usually) with their malicious links in order to portray legitimacy lull you into a false sense of security. If you suss out that a DM is a fake, report it as Spam using red aReport Spama button at top of DM. This feature is one of many improvements that weare working on to help identify remove bad actors as soon as weare aware of them. a Free Nitro Scams One of oldest scams is temptation of afree Nitro.a While we canat discount people who may be truly full of generosity believe in gifting Nitro, getting a random DM from a stranger claiming to have chosen *you* for a Nitro giveaway is incredibly sus, most likely a scam. Discord will never ask you to scan a QR code in order to redeem a Nitro code. Do NOT scan any QR codes from people you donat know those you canat verify as legitimate. If you ever use QR Code Login to sign in to Discord, make sure youare using desktop app, if youare on web app, that your URL bar says ahttps://discord.com/logina exactly as it's written. above tactics are some of ways that scammers may attempt to socially-engineer you into giving up your information. Even if you donat click any of their links, it's best to simply block report them to us, rather than engage further. We encourage you to share this article with friends who may not be as informed as you a when everyoneas aware, our communities are safer than ever. Hereas a quick link back to Protecting Against Scams on Discord too. Stay safe out there! How Trust-Safety Addresses Violent Extremism on Discord Our History with Violent Extremism Weave been paying close attention to violent extremist groups movements ever since we learned how organizers of 2017 Unite Right Rally in Charlottesville, Virginia utilized Discord to plan their hateful activities. Back then, Discord Trust & Safety was a team of one, just beginning to make difficult decisions about how to properly moderate platform. Almost four years later, our Trust & Safety Team makes up 15% of Discordas near-400 employees splits its time between responding to user reports now proactively finding removing servers users engaging in high-harm activity like violent extremist organizing. Trust & Safety has spent a lot of time since 2017 trying to ensure that another event like Charlottesville isnat planned on our platform. Our team developed frameworks based on academic research on violent extremist radicalization behavior to better identify extremist users who try to use Discord to recruit organize. We keep up-to-date on research that can lend insight into how to evaluate understand extremist behavior online, our recent partnerships with organizations like Global Internet Forum for Countering Terrorism (GIFCT) Tech Against Terrorism (TAT) are intended to support this effort. How We Identify Violent Extremism Categorizing violent extremism itself is difficult because not all extremists have same motives believe in same ideas. Some individuals who adopt violent ideologies act on their beliefs by joining organized hate, terrorist, violent extremist groups. Others donat want to officially identify themselves as belonging to a particular movement, may instead form looser connections with others who have adopted same worldview. Different cultural contexts also influence belief systems behaviors, so violent extremist ideologies in one country will naturally be different from those on other side of world. Violent extremism is nuanced ideologies tactics behind them evolve fast. We donat try to apply our own labels identify a certain atypea of extremism. Instead, we evaluate user accounts, servers, content that is flagged to us based on common characteristics patterns of behavior, such as: Itas important to note that presence of one two of these signals doesnat automatically mean that we would classify a server as aviolent extremist.a While we might use these signs to help us determine a user spaceas intent purpose, we always want to understand context in which user content is posted before taking any action. How Did We Do on January 6? On day of Insurrection, our Trust & Safety agents were reviewing reports of hate speech, glorification of violence, misinformation about what was transpiring. We feel very fortunate that our team was able to locate remove many of most harmful servers dedicated to coordinating violence on January 6. Our ability to move proactively on servers advocating for violence was thanks to two main factors: first, we were able to surface reports from users on these spaces quickly; second, our Trust & Safety agents dedicated to countering violent extremism had been tracking these spaces ever since allegations of election fraud regarding 2020 U.S. presidential election had begun to spread. We believe itas important to talk about line we walk with Discord users who discuss politics to organize political activities like protests. Many people are frustrated with how society works how some governmental societal systems are structured. Naturally, people have strong opinions on how things should shouldnat change. Now more than ever, itas important for meaningful conversations, debates, exchanges of ideas to take place. Weare glad that users across world have turned to Discord to discuss their opinions beliefs, to organize, to advocate for change they want to see. Discord Trust & Safetyas objective is to ensure that no harm comes to our users, to society at large, because of actions taken on Discord, which is why we donat tolerate activities that promote advocate for violence. When weare reviewing reports for violent extremism, while itas sometimes clear when users servers have crossed that line, in many cases thereas a lot more context to consider. One of most difficult responsibilities of our work is balancing mitigation of potential harm without appearing as if we are overstepping any boundaries censoring meaningful conversation. Looking to Future Because of these values, we plan to continue standing firm against ideologies of hate that violent extremist communities espouse, we are excited to work with other platforms organizations that seek to do same. Stay tuned for more updates. We know that we canat solve violent extremism alone, but weall continue to do our best to make sure that communities on Discord reflect our company values. We want Discord a internet as a whole a to be a space for positive interactions creating belonging. If you would like to report dangerous harmful activity to Trust & Safety team, please do so using our report form. If youare unsure how to report a user server, take a look at dis.gd/HowToReport. How we investigate When we receive a report from a Discord user, Trust & Safety team looks through available evidence gathers as much information as possible. This investigation is centered around reported messages, but can expand if evidence shows that thereas a bigger violation. For example, we may investigate whether entire server is dedicated to bad behavior, if behavior appears to be part of a wider pattern. We spend a lot of time on this process because we believe context in which something is posted is important can change meaning entirely. We might ask reporting user for more information to help our investigation. Responding to user reports is an important part of our Trust & Safety teamas work, but we know there is also violating content on Discord that might go unreported. This is where we get proactive. Our goal is to stop bad actors their activity before anyone else encounters it. We prioritize getting rid of worst-of-the-worst content because it has absolutely no place on Discord, because risk of harm is high. We focus our efforts on exploitative content, in particular non-consensual pornography sexual content related to minors, as well as violent extremism. Please note: We do not monitor every server every conversation. Privacy is incredibly important to us we try to balance it thoughtfully with our duty to prevent harm. However, we scan images uploaded to our platform to detect child sexual abuse material. When we have data suggesting that a user is engaging in illegal activity violating our policies, we investigate their networks, activity on Discord, their messages to proactively detect accomplices determine whether violations have occurred. a a Four steps to a super safe server 1. Set up roles permissions Roles are one of building blocks of managing a Discord server. They give your members a fancy color, but more importantly, each role comes with a set of permissions that control what your members can cannot do in server. With roles, you can give members bots administrative permissions like kicking banning members, adding removing channels, pinging @everyone. You can find these options in Roles section of your Server Settings. Assign permissions with care! Certain permissions allow members to make changes to your server channels. These permissions are a great moderation tool, but be wary of who you grant this power to. Changes made to your server canat be undone. You can learn more about implementing roles permissions in Role Management 101 our Setting Up Permissions FAQ article. 2. Set a verification level Server verification levels allow you to control who can send messages in your server. Setting a high verification level is a great way to protect your server from spammers raids. You can find this option in Safety Setup section of your Server Settings. 3. Enable server-wide 2FA When enabled, server-wide two-factor authentication (2FA) requires all of your moderators administrators to have 2FA enabled on their accounts in order to take administrative actions, like deleting messages. You can read more about 2FA here. By requiring all admin accounts to have 2FA turned on, you protect your server from malicious users who might try to compromise one of your moderators' administrators' accounts then make unwanted changes to your server. If you are server owner, you can enable 2FA requirement for moderation in Safety Setup section of your Server Settings. You must have 2FA enabled on your own account before you can enable this option! 4. Explicit image filter explicit image filter automatically blocks messages in a server that may contain explicit images in channels not marked as Age-restricted. You can control this feature so that it applies to all server members, just to members without roles a you can turn this feature off altogether. Age-restricted channels are exempt from explicit image filter. Turning this filter on allows your server members to share content while reducing risk of explicit images being posted in channels that are not age-restricted. You can access this setting by navigating to Server Settings, under Moderation, select SafetySetup, then find Explicit image filter heading. What is Discord? Discord Glossary Discord has its own vocabulary. You might hear your teen students using these words when talking about Discord. Server: Servers are spaces on Discord. They are made by specific communities friend groups. vast majority of servers are small invitation-only. Some larger servers are public. Any user can start a new server for free invite their friends to it. Channel: Discord servers are organized into text voice channels, which are usually dedicated to specific topics can have different rules. DMs GDMs: Users can send private messages to other users as a direct message (DM), as well as start a voice video call. Most DMs are one-on-one conversations, but users have option to invite up to nine others to conversation to create a private group DM (GDM), with a maximum size of ten people. Group DMs are not public require an invite from someone in group to join. Go Live: users can share their screen with other people who are in a server a DM with them. Nitro: Nitro is Discordas premium subscription service. Nitro offers special perks for subscribers, such as option to customize your Discord Tag, ability to use custom emotes in every server, a higher file upload cap, discounted Server Boosts. Server Boosts: If your teen is a big fan of a community, they might want to boost communityas server (or their own). Like Nitro, Server Boosts give servers special perks like more custom emotes, better video voice quality, ability to set a custom invite link. Server Boosts can be bought with Nitro purchased separately. Student Hubs: Discord Hubs for Students allow students to verify their Discord account with their official student email, unlock access to an exclusive hub for students at their school. Within hub, they can connect with other verified students, discover servers for study groups classes, share their own servers for fellow students to join.

I canat imagine life without it.a Genavieve, a high-school student from California, talks about how her classes use Discord: ""I've been using Discord for last two years as my main communication with my friends. We had too many people in our group chat wanted a platform where we could all communicate with each other. Discord is a great way for a friend group of thirty people to stay in touch! Also, with distance learning in place, Iave started using it with my AP Physics class too. It's been so important to feel connected to our teachers each other when we are so isolated in such a difficult class. Using Discord brought us closer together as a class a we are already a small class of 22 students, so being able to joke around send memes helps us not feel so alone during distance learning. different channels @mentions make it much easier to keep information straight. Screenshare makes it even easier, so we can show each other documents problems we are working on to get feedback troubleshooting advice.a David, a physics math tutor from New Jersey, talks about how he teaches students connects with other teachers over Discord: ""I use Discord to tutor one of my students to stay up to date with conversations announcements in a group of physics teachers interested in physics education research. It's nice to see a side-by-side camera view of my desk with student's work.

Our Approach to Content ModerationA We currently employ three levers to moderate user content on Discord, while being mindful of user privacy:A Our Community Guidelines define what is isn't okay to do on Discord. Every person on Discord should feel like their voice can be heard, but not at expense of someone else. If you come across a message that appears to break these rules, please report it to your server moderator to us. If content behavior violates our Guidelines we may take a number of enforcement actions including but not limited to issuing warnings; removing content; disabling removing accounts and/or servers responsible; reporting them to law enforcement. Learn more about our Community Guidelines here Terms of Service here. a a What actions we take When our Trust & Safety team confirms that there has been a violation of our Community Guidelines, team takes immediate steps to mitigate harm and, wherever possible, help users avoid breaking rules in future. following are actions that we might take on either users and/or servers: Discord also works with law enforcement agencies in cases of immediate danger and/or self-harm. We swiftly report child abuse material content users responsible to National Center for Missing Exploited Children. a a How You Can Appeal Our Actions Every user can appeal actions taken against their account.A While we do our best to ensure that weare only taking action when itas warranted, weare not perfect mistakes might happen. We recognize appeals are an important part of process. Just as you deserve a chance to be heard when some action is taken against you offline, you should have such a chance to be heard when action is taken against your Discord account by us. process reflects Discord's commitment to internationally recognized human rights set out in United Nations Guiding Principles on Business Human Rights (UNGPs), privacy, free expression.

In some cases, we are unable to review certain appeals due to nature of violation incomplete information provided. Even if we canat review appeal, your feedback helps us improve these systems over time. If your teen encounters an issue Even though majority of Discord usage is in small, private, invite-only groups, we understand that there may be times when people in these groups behave in ways that make others uncomfortable post content that isnat allowed. Our Community Guidelines outline how all users should act on Discord what we allow do not allow. We recommend reviewing these with your teen so that you both know what behavior is isnat okay on platform. Among other things, we do not allow: If your teen encounters a violation of our Community Guidelines, such as harassment inappropriate content, please file a report with details that you can gather. Our Trust & Safety team strives to ensure bad users don't disrupt your teenas experience on Discord. We also provide a number of tools to ensure that teens (and everyone else) have control over their Discord experience. a a Answering parents' educators' top questions 1. Is Discord safe for my teens to use? There are a few things that make Discord a great safe place for teens: To help your teen use Discord safely, itas important to understand how Discord works how you can best control your teenas experience on it. We have listed a number of tips to do so here. Just like with every other online service, best way to ensure your teen stays safe online is to have clear guidelines on what they should shouldnat be looking at posting online, make sure that you keep clear lines of communication with them. 2. What is minimum age to be on Discord? How do you ensure teens under 13 canat create an account? Discord's Terms of Service require people to be over a minimum age to access our app website. minimum age to access Discord is 13, unless local legislation mandates an older age. To ensure that users satisfy that minimum age requirement, users are asked to confirm their date of birth upon creating an account. Learn more about how we use this age information here. If a user is reported as being under 13, we delete their account unless they can verify that they are at least 13 years old using an official ID document. 3. What personal information does Discord collect about my teen? Do you sell it? Discord does not ask for a real name when a user signs up, we do not sell user data. To learn more about what information we collect how we use this information, please see our Privacy Policy. 4. Can my teen be exposed to inappropriate content on Discord? Like on every internet platform, there is age-restricted content on Discord. Each user chooses which servers they want to join who they want to interact with. In servers, age-restricted content must be posted in a channel marked as age-restricted, which cannot be accessed by users under 18. For Direct Messages, we recommend that every user under 18 activates explicit media content filter by selecting ""Keep Me Safe"" under ""Safe Direct Messaging"" heading in Privacy & Safety section of their User Settings. When a user chooses ""Keep Me Safe"" setting, images videos in all direct messages are scanned by Discord explicit media content is blocked. We believe that best way to make sure that your teenagers are only accessing content that they should is to set clear guidelines on what they should shouldnat be looking at posting online, make sure that you keep clear lines of communication with them. 5. Can my teen interact with people they donat know on Discord? Unlike other platforms where someone might be able to message you as soon as you sign up for an account (before you have added any friends joined any servers), this isnat case on Discord. In order for another user to send a direct message (DM)A to your teen, your teen must either (1)A accept other user as a friend (2) decide to join a server that other user is a member of. Each user has control over following: Users should only accept friend requests from users that they know trust. If your teen isnat sure, thereas no harm in rejecting friend request. They can always add that user later if itas a mistake. If your teen is ever uncomfortable interacting with someone on Discord, they can always block that specific user. Blocking a user removes them from your teen's Friends List, prevents them from messaging your teen directly, hides their messages in any shared servers. 6. Are there parental controls on Discord I can use to control my teen's account? We have detailed all controls you have to help make your teenas account safer here. We recommend going through these settings together with your teen having an open conversation about why you are choosing certain settings. iOS Android operating systems offer parental controls that can help you manage your teen's phone usage, including Discord, if needed. Apple Microsoft offer similar controls for computers. 7. How can I monitor what my teen is doing on Discord? Privacy is incredibly important to us, including your teenas privacy. We canat share their login information with you, but we encourage you to discuss how to use Discord safely directly with your teen. 8. What are Student Hubs? Discord Hubs for Students allow students to verify their Discord account with their official student email, unlock access to an exclusive hub for students at their school. Within hub, they can connect with other verified students, discover servers for study groups classes, share their own servers for fellow students to join. Hubs are not affiliated with managed by a school school staff. Servers in a Hub are student-run but may include non-students. For more information on Student Hubs, please check out our Student Hubs FAQs. 9. What safety measures are in place for students participating in Student Hubs? Only those with a school-assigned email address can access a schoolas specific hub. Click here to dive into our Student Hubs guidelines. All servers users in hub must also comply with our Community Guidelines, Terms of Service, Privacy Policy. We also have all of our existing moderator controls for servers, such as setting specific roles access to #channels in a server, blocking, banning, mod bots, more. Students can also submit a report from within their hub to bring attention to any inappropriate behavior. Role of administrators moderators on Discord Administrators are people who create Discord servers around specific interests. They establish rules for participating, can invite people to join, oversee health well-being of their community. They have broad administrative control, can bring in moderators to manage community members. They can also ban remove members and, if necessary, remove replace moderators. Administrators also choose moderators to play a vital role in Discord communities. responsibilities of a moderator might vary, but their overall role is to ensure that their Discord server is a safe, healthy environment for everyone. They can do things like moderate delete messages, as well as invite, ban, suspend people who violate serveras rules. best moderators typically are seasoned enthusiastic participants in one more communities. Admins moderators are your first go-to when you encounter an issue in a server. They may be able to respond immediately help resolve your concerns. Each Discord server should have written rules for behavior to alleviate confusion misunderstanding about guidelines for that particular community. These rules, which supplement our Community Guidelines, are your tools to moderate efficiently transparently. As communities grow, moderators can add more mods to keep their server a fun welcoming place to be. a a",https://discord.com/safety-library

Expanding Our Policies Beyond our work with Crisis Text Line, Digital Wellness Lab, National PTA, we continue to build out efforts resources that help people on Discord build belonging support one another to overcome impossible. Finding a community that is navigating similar challenges can be incredibly helpful for healing. That said, platforms have a critical role to play to ensure these digital spaces donat attempt to normalize promote hurtful behaviors encourage other users to engage in acts of self-harm. We recently expanded our Self Harm Encouragement Promotion Policy to ensure this type of content is addressed on Discord. We do not allow any content behavior that promotes encourages individuals to commit acts of self-harm on Discord. We also prohibit content that seeks to normalize self-harming behaviors, as well as content that discourages individuals from seeking help for self-harm behaviors. Weare committed to mental wellbeing helping our users uplift each other their communities. Our newly-implemented partnerships resources developed with support of Crisis Text Line, Digital Wellness Lab, National PTA are an important addition to our ongoing work to give everyone power to create space to find belonging in their lives. Building a Safer Place for Teens to Hang Out Choose what you see who you want to hang with Introducing our new Teen Safety Assist initiative: Teen Safety Assist is focused on further protecting teens by introducing a new series of features, including multiple safety alerts sensitive content filters that will be default enabled for teen users. Starting next week, weare excited to release first two features of Teen Safety Assist initiative. Teens have shared that they like tools that help them avoid unwanted direct messages (DMs) media. To support this, weare rolling out safety alerts on senders sensitive content filters that automatically blur media that may be sensitive a even if sender doesnat initially blur it with a spoiler tag.A a Weave partnered with technology non-profit Thorn to design these features together based on their guidance on teen online safety behaviors what works best to help protect teens. Our partnership has focused on empowering teens to take control over safety how best to guide teens to helpful tips resources. Weare grateful for support of Thorn to ensure we build right protections empower teens with tools resources they need to have a safer online experience. first two features of Teen Safety initiative will start rolling out globally in November 2023 will be turned on by default for teen users. Stay tuned for many more features from this initiative as we look ahead to next year. Work together to keep each other safe We know mistakes happen rules are accidentally broken. Our new Warning System includes multiple touchpoints so users can easily understand rule violations consequences. These touchpoints provide more transparency into Discord interventions, letting users know how their violation may impact their overall account standing gives information for them to do better in future. We built this system so users can learn how to do better in future help keep all hangouts safe.A Some violations are more serious than others, weall take appropriate action depending on severity of violation. For example, we have will continue to have a zero-tolerance policy towards violent extremism content that sexualizes children. Warning System is built based on our teen-centric policies. This is a multi-year, focused effort to invest more deeply holistically into our teen safety efforts. We incorporate teen-centric philosophies in how we enforce our policies, assess risks of new products with Safety by Design, communicate our policies in an age-appropriate manner. For Warning System, this means that we consider how teens are growing, learning, taking age-appropriate risks as they mature, we give them more opportunities to learn from mistakes rather than punish them harshly. Warning System starts rolling out today in select regions. Stay tuned for many more updates to our Warning System in future. a For our server moderators admins, weave recently expanded their safety toolkit with new features that allow them to proactively identify potentially unsafe activity, such as server raids DM spam, take swift actions as needed.A We began rolling these tools in September to Community Servers, now weare rolling them out to all servers. You choose what stays private While you might be an open book with your friends, having your personal business out there for everyone to see can feel a bit weird. Thatas why you get to decide, from server to server, how much you want to share how easy it is to contact you. With Server Profiles, you can adjust to how you present yourself in different spaces, allowing you to be as much of real ayoua as you feel comfortable being in any particular group.A You can also always try turning on Message Requests: a feature that sends any DM from someone new into a separate inbox requires your approval before that user can DM you again. Or, go extra mile turn off DMs entirely from server members unless youave explicitly added them to your friends list. Weave got you PHEW, okaya that was a lot. Thanks for stickina around jamming through our most recent updates with us. Everything you could ever want to know about safety privacy on Discord, even more if youare learning type of person, lives in our Safety Library a check it out for more tips on making Discord safe comfortable for you. a This article was first published on 10/24/2023. Building a better place to play chill together as teens go back to school Building with teens, for teens At Discord, weare constantly working to make our platform best place for our users, including teens, to hang out with their friends online. An important part of doing this right way is listening to teen users' concerns ideas directly. Since end of 2023, weave conducted 30 focus groups globally to speak with teens about their firsthand experiences perspectives on how to shape Discordas features to meet their needs. We collected ideas from teens global organizations specializing in teen safety a like Digital Wellness Lab, NoFiltras Youth Innovation Council, ThinkYoung a to create an aspirational charter that helps us understand how teens want to feel on Discord. We learned about what tools a like muting a conversation tailoring who can send you a friend request a are most helpful for teens to remediate uncomfortable situations. We also heard new ideas for additional safety privacy features that have helped shape our product focus. A Teen Charter for a better place to hang out Teens have spoken, we have taken what they said to heart. We learned a ton when speaking with our teen users, weare excited to reveal our co-created Teen Charter. Teen Charter outlines principles that matter most to them: authenticity, inclusivity, privacy, transparency. This set of principles represents expectations teens have of each other of Discord.a While our Community Guidelines explain what is what isnat allowed on Discord, we hope Teen Charter principles will ultimately guide users to take on a shared responsibility in creating a fun comfortable space to play chill with their friends. These principles will also help inform product policy improvements on Discord, serving as a guiding beacon for us to help teen users thrive.A We want to help teens forge maintain genuine friendships, we know that can only happen when they feel safe connecting with one another on our platform. A starting point for guardians parents Weare excited to announce launch of our Guardianas Guide to help guardians parents better understand Discord, how platform works, equip them with tools needed to check in with teens start conversations about building positive online behaviors.a We know guardians have a lot of great resources to help their teens navigate online world, but we wanted to provide a resource about Discord, from Discord. Guardianas Guide is a centralized asset that helps adults who are raising teens understand latest highlights of how Discord works, information on how their teen might spend time on Discord, shares tips resources to talk to teens about keeping their online experiences comfortable. We consistently offer updated info on our Safety Center, but this resource helps streamline these topics.

Calling all Discord Moderators Community Managers! Clarifying our Dangerous Regulated Goods Policy Existing Dangerous Regulated Goods Policy Our guidelines state that users may not organize, promote, engage in buying, selling, trading of dangerous regulated goods. This has always been our policy will not be changing. We want to use this opportunity to talk a little bit more about what we consider to be a adangerous regulated gooda how this policy will apply: Examples Exceptions To help put this policy into context, here are some examples of situations we would would not take action against under this policy: Enforcing Existing Policy We may take any number of enforcement actions in response to users servers that are attempting to buy, sell, trade dangerous regulated goods on Discord a including warning an account, server, entire moderator team; removing harmful content; permanently suspending an account server. Looking Ahead After receiving feedback from our community, we are evaluating potential for unintended consequences negative impacts of age-restricted requirement. Our existing guidelines on Dangerous Regulated Goods remain as stated, however we are assessing how best to support server moderators regarding age-restricted requirement to ensure we are not preventing positive online engagement. We regularly evaluate assess our policies to ensure Discord remains a safe welcoming place, plan to update our Community Guidelines in coming months. We will provide any important updates on this policy then. full list of content behaviors not allowed on Discord can be found in our Community Guidelines. Our Safety Center Policy & Safety Blog are also great resources if you would like to read more about our approach to safety our policies. Defending Your Online Spaces Editor's Note: On July 1 2024, Supreme Court reaffirmed that moderation decisions are protected by First Amendment of U.S. Constitution. You can read our response to this ruling here. Today, Discord filed an amicus brief with Supreme Court in support of our ongoing efforts to create online communities of shared interests that are safe, welcoming, inclusive. cases at issue (Moody v. NetChoice, et al. NetChoice et al. v. Paxton) challenge constitutionality of two new laws in Texas Florida. You may have heard of them: these laws would significantly restrict ability of online services to remove content that is objectionableA to their users force them to keep a wide range of alawful but awfula content on their sites. Discord is not a traditional social media service, but whether intended not, laws are broad enough to likely impact services like ours. Itas hard to overstate potential impact if these laws are allowed to go into effect: they would fundamentally change how services like Discord operate, with that, experiences we deliver to you. Thereas no doubt that outcome here is hugely important to us as a company, but that alone is not why we are taking a stand. Ultimately, we filed this brief because important context was missing from official record: you all vibrant communities youave built on Discord. Taking a step back, Discord has invested heavily in creating safe fun online spaces. Our Community Guidelines set rules for how we all engage on Discord, we put a lot of effort into enforcing them: around 15% of company works on safety, including content moderation. This includes Trust Safety agents who enforce Discordas rules, engineers who develop moderation tools for both Discord its users, many more dedicated individuals across our company. We do this work so that you can create those online spaces where you can find foster genuine connection. But in order to bring this world to life, Discord needs to be able to prevent, detect, remove harmful speech conduct. Barring companies like Discord from moderating content is a little like barring garbage collection in a city: every individual block would have to devote its own resources to hauling its own garbage, diverting those limited resources from more productive activities individualized curation that makes each neighborhood unique. So, while our rules content moderation efforts certainly reflect our own values speech about kind of services we want to offer, we really do it for you allawe work to take care of hard stuff so you all can focus on creating communities you want. Thatas why we decided to take such a strong position in these cases: we want to make sure Supreme Court understands how these laws would impact your speech your communities. Fortunately, First Amendment has a lot to say about thisait protects your association rights, which make it possible for you to come together around your shared interests see content that is relevant helpful, not harmful.A Keeping your communities fun safe by not allowing harmful content is a top priority for us. We wouldnat be doing what we do without all of you, we will keep working to make sure you can create online spaces you want.A A Discordas Commitment to Teen Child Safety Our Policies You can read an overview of following policies here. Teen Self-Endangerment Policy Teen self-endangerment is a nuanced issue that we do not take lightly. We want our teen users to be able to express themselves freely on Discord while also taking steps to ensure these users donat engage in risky behaviors that might endanger their safety well-being. In order to help our teenage users stay safe, our policies state that users under age of 18 are not allowed to send access any sexually explicit content. Even when this kind of content is shared consensually between teens, there is a risk that self-generated sexual media can be saved shared outside of their private conversations. We want to help our users avoid finding themselves in these situations. In this context, we also believe that dating online can result in self-endangerment. Under this policy, teen dating servers are prohibited on Discord we will take action against users who are engaging in this behavior. Additionally, older teens engaging in grooming of a younger teen will be reviewed actioned under our Inappropriate Sexual Conduct with Children Grooming Policy. Through our thorough work partnership with a prominent child safety organization, we determined that we will, when possible, warn teens who have engaged in sexually explicit behavior before moving to a full ban. An example of this includes teens sharing explicit content with each other that is not their own content. Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) Child Sexualization Policy Discord has a zero-tolerance policy for child sexual abuse, which does not have a place on ourA platform a anywhere in society. We do not allow CSAM on Discord, including AI-generated photorealistic CSAM. When such imagery is found, imagery is reported to National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC). This ensures that sexualization of children in any context is not normalized by bad actors. Inappropriate Sexual Conduct with Teens Grooming Policy Discord has a zero-tolerance policy for inappropriate sexual conduct with children grooming. Grooming is inappropriate sexual contact between adults teens on platform, with special attention given to predatory behaviors such as online enticement sexual extortion of children, commonly referred to as asextortion.a When we become aware of these types of incidents, we take appropriate action, including banning accounts of offending adult users reporting them to NCMEC, which subsequently works with local law enforcement.A How We Work to Keep Our Younger Users Safe Our Safety team works hard to find remove abhorrent, harmful content, take action including banning users responsible engaging with proper authorities. Discordas Safety by Design practice includes a risk assessment process during product development cycle that helps identify mitigate potential risks to user safety. We recognize that teens have unique vulnerabilities in online settings this process allows us to better safeguard their experience. Through this process, we think carefully about how product features might disproportionately impact teens consider whether product facilitates more teen-to-adult interactions and/or any unintended harm. Our teams identify strategize ways to mitigate safety risks with internal safety technology solutions during this process through getting insight recommendations from external partners. Discord uses a mix of proactive reactive tools to remove content that violates our policies, from use of advanced technology like machine learning models PhotoDNA image hashing to partnering with community moderators to uphold our policies providing in-platform reporting mechanisms to surface violations. Our Terms of Service require people to be over a minimum age (13, unless local legislation mandates an older age) to access our website. We use an age gate that asks users to provide their date of birth upon creating an account. If a user is reported as being under 13, we delete their account. Users can only appeal to restore their account by providing an official ID document to verify their age.A Additionally, we require that all age-restricted content is placed in a channel clearly labeled as age-restricted, which triggers an age gate, preventing users under 18 from accessing that content. newest launches of safety products are focused on helping to safeguard teen experience with our safety alerts on senders that educate teens on ways they can control their experience limit unwanted contact. Additionally, sensitive content filters provide additional controls for teens to blur block unwanted content. Rather than assigning prescriptive solutions for teens, we aim to empower teens with respect for their agency, privacy, decision-making power. Additionally, we are expanding our own Trusted Reporter Network in collaboration with INHOPE for direct communication with expert third parties, including researchers, industry peers, journalists for intelligence sharing. Our Technology Solutions Machine learning has proven to be an essential component of safety solutions at Discord. Since our acquisition of Sentropy, a leader in AI-powered moderation systems, we have continued to balance technology with judgment contextual assessment of highly trained employees, along with continuing to maintain our strong stance on user privacy. Below is an overview of some of our key investments in technology: Teen Safety Assist: Teen Safety Assist is focused on further protecting teens by introducing a new series of features, including multiple safety alerts sensitive content filters that will be default-enabled for teen users. Safety Rules Engine: Safety Rules Engine allows our teams to evaluate user activities on platform, including registrations, server joins, other metadata. We then analyze patterns of problematic behavior to make informed decisions take uniform actions like user challenges bans. AutoMod: Automod is a powerful tool for community moderators to automatically filter unwanted messages with certain keywords, block profiles that may be impersonating a server admin appear harmful to their server, detect harmful messages using machine learning. This technology empowers community moderators to keep their communities safe without having to spend long hours manually reviewing removing unwanted content on their servers. Visual safety platform: Discord has continued to invest in improving image classifiers for content such as sexual, gore, violent media. With these, our machine learning models are being improved to reach higher precision detection rates with lower error rates decrease teen exposure to potentially inappropriate mature content. We proactively scan images uploaded to our platform using PhotoDNA to detect child sexual abuse material (CSAM) report any CSAM content perpetrators to NCMEC, who subsequently work with local law enforcement to take appropriate action. Investing in technological advancements tools to proactively detect CSAM grooming is a key priority for us, we have a dedicated team to handle related content. In Q2 2023, we proactively removed 99% of servers found to be hosting CSAM. You can find more information in Discordas latest Transparency Report. There is constant innovation taking place within beyond Discord to improve how companies can effectively scale deliver content moderation. Our approach will continue to evolve as time goes on, as weare constantly finding new ways to do better for our users. Partnerships We know that collaboration is important, weare continuously working with experts partners so that we have a holistic informed approach to combating sexual exploitation of children. Weare grateful to collaborate with Tech Coalition NoFiltr to help young people stay safer on Discord.A With our new series of products under Teen Safety Assist initiative, Discord has launched a safety alert for teens to help flag when a teen might want to double-check that they want to reply to a particular new direct message. Weave partnered with technology non-profit Thorn to design these features together based on their guidance on teen online safety behaviors what works best to help protect teens. Our partnership is focused on empowering teens to take control over safety how best to guide teens to helpful tips resources. Additional Resources Want to learn more about Discordas safety work? Check out these resources below: We look forward to continuing this important work deepening our partnerships to ensure we continue to have a holistic nuanced approach to teen child safety. Evolving our Policies to Keep You Safe Threats, Hate Speech, Violent Extremism Hate harm targeted at individuals communities is not tolerated on Discord in any way, combating this behavior content is a top priority for us. We evolved our Threats Policy to address threats of harm to others. Under this policy, we will take action against direct indirect threats, veiled threats, those who encourage this behavior, conditional statements to cause harm. We also refined our Hate Speech Policy with input from a group of experts who study identity intersectionality came from a variety of different identities backgrounds themselves. Under this policy, we define ahate speecha as any form of expression that denigrates, vilifies, dehumanizes; promotes intense, irrational feelings of enmity hatred; incites harm against people based on protected characteristics. In addition, weave expanded our list of protected characteristics to go beyond what most hate speech laws cover to include following: age; caste; color; disability; ethnicity; family responsibilities; gender; gender identity; housing status; national origin; race; refugee immigration status; religious affiliation; serious illness; sex; sexual orientation; socioeconomic class status; source of income; status as a victim of domestic violence, sexual violence, stalking; and, weight size. A Last year, we wrote about how we address Violent Extremism on Discord. We are deeply committed to our work in this space have updated our Violent Extremism Policy to prohibit any kind of support, promotion, organization of violent extremist groups ideologies. We worked closely with a violent extremism subject-matter expert to update this policy will continue to work with third-party organizations like Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism European Union Internet Forum to ensure it is enforced properly. Financial Scams, Fraud Services, Malicious Conduct During 2022, we invested significantly in how we combat criminal activity on Discord. In February, we released two blogs to help users identify protect themselves against scams on Discord. Alongside these, we developed a Financial Scams Policy which prohibits three types of common scams: identity scams, investment scams, financial scams. We will take action against users who scam others use Discord to coordinate scamming operations. In case of users who have been victim of fraudulent activity, we recommend they report activity to Discord contact law enforcement, who will be able to follow up with us for more information if it helps their investigation. Under our new Fraud Services Policy, we've expanded our definitions of what constitutes fraudulent behavior. We will take action against users who engage in reselling stolen ill-gotten digital goods are involved in coordinated efforts to defraud businesses engage in price gouging, forgery, money laundering. We also do not allow any kind of activity that could damage compromise security of an account, computer network, system under our updated Malicious Conduct Policy. We will take action against users who use Discord to host distribute malware, carry out phishing attempts denial-of-service attacks against others. Whatas Next User safety is our top priority weare committed to ensuring Discord continues to be a safe welcoming place. We regularly evaluate assess our policies in collaboration with experts, industry-leading groups, partner organizations. We look forward to continuing our work in this important area plan to share further updates down road. How Discord Prevents Removes Spam We invested a substantial amount of time resources into combating spam in 2022, disabling 141,087,602 accounts for spam spam-related offenses, with a proactive removal rate of 99%, before we receive a user report. We observed a significant increase in number of accounts disabled during third quarter of 2022, leading to an elevated but lower fourth quarter, then to a substantial decrease in first quarter of 2023. These trends can be attributed to both increased ongoing investments in our anti-spam team a shift in our approach to reducing number of disabled accounts by placing greater confidence in our proactive spam mitigations avoiding false positives. As a result, only .004% of accounts disabled submitted an appeal during past quarter. Spammers are constantly evolving adapting to new technologies methods of detection, moving to use new parts of platform to target users. Combating spam requires a multi-faceted approach that employs new tools technologies, while also remaining vigilant adaptable to changing trends. We're constantly updating our approach to remove spam, as our proactive efforts have increased, we've observed a steady decline in number of reports we receive for spam. a above trends were made possible over past year due to a number of technological advances in both back-end front-end features, products, tools to help prevent remove spam from Discord. Discord is committed to combating spam building a safer environment for people to find belonging. We've grown our teams, shipped new features, products, tools, continue to listen closely to users about how spam impacts their experience on Discord. We're constantly updating our approach to remove spam remain vigilant adaptable to changing trends. We will continue to prioritize safety work hard to combat spam in order to help make Discord best place for people communities to hang out online. How We Leverage Machine Learning to Fight Child Sexual Abuse Material Weare bridging a key gap in CSAM detection To understand how tech industry is working to solve these challenges, itas helpful to understand technology itself. industry standard for CSAM detection is a tool called PhotoDNA, which was developed by Microsoft donated to National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC)athe nationally recognized hub for reporting suspected online child sexual exploitation in US. When imagery depicting child sexual abuse is reported to NCMEC, PhotoDNA is used to create a unique digital signature (or ahasha) of that image. That hashaand not illegal imagery itselfais stored in a database that serves as a reference point for online detection efforts. At Discord, we proactively scan images using hashing algorithms (including PhotoDNA) to detect known CSAM. For example, if someone uploads an image that matches against known CSAM that has been previously reported, we automatically detect it, remove it, flag it for internal review. When we confirm that someone attempted to share illegal imagery, we remove content, permanently ban them from our platform, report them to NCMEC, who subsequently works with law enforcement.A There are more than 6.3 million hashes of CSAM in NCMECas hash database more than 29 million hashes of CSAM contained in databases from around world. That gives tech industry a strong foundation for stopping spread of this harmful material on our platforms. But thereas one key limitation: it only detects exact similar copies of images that are already logged in database. This means that predatory actors will try to exploit this weakness with unknown CSAM that has yet to be seen logged, indicating that there is either a likelihood of active abuse, images were synthetically generated using AI. Machine learning helps us stop CSAM at scale Unknown CSAM has continually plagued our industry our team felt it was important to advance our own detection capabilities. We started with an open-source model that can analyze images to understand what they are depicting. Our engineers experimented found that we could use this model to not only determine how similar one image is to another, but due to semantic understanding of model, it also demonstrated promising results for novel CSAM detection. When we find a match, we follow same process that we use for PhotoDNA matches: A human reviews it to verify if it is an instance of CSAM. If it is, itas reported to NCMEC added to PhotoDNA database. From that point, newly verified image can be detected automatically across platforms. This speeds up review process, expands database of known CSAM, makes everyone better faster at blocking CSAM over time. This is a major advancement in effort to detect, report, stop spread of CSAM. At a recent Tech Coalition hackathon, engineers from Discord other tech companies collaborated on ways we can work together to identify new forms of CSAM that evade existing detection methods. During this collaboration, we were able to work to make AI-powered detection mechanism we built open-source. At Discord, we believe safety shouldnat be proprietary a competitive advantage. Our hope is that by making this technology open source, we can bring new capabilities protections to all tech platforms, especially newer companies that donat yet have established trust safety teams. This is part of our work alongside Lantern program, which is committed to stopping people from evading CSAM detection across platforms. Together, weare working to increase prevention detection methods, accelerate identification processes, share information on predatory tactics, strengthen our collective reporting to authorities. Ultimately, this is an ideal use of machine learning technology. Itas important to note, though, that human expertise judgment is still involved. Our expert staff continues to review anything thatas not an exact match with PhotoDNA, because stakes are high we need to get it right. What matters most is that combined efforts of machine learning human expertise are making it harder than ever for predatory actors to evade detection. Weare working to build a safer internet. Itas in our DNA. Safety is a top priority at Discord. Itas reflected in our personnel: roughly 15% of our staff is dedicated to safety. These teams work to ensure our platform, features, policies result in a positive safe place for our users to hang out build community. Weare stronger together safety landscape is continually shifting. There are always new challenges emerging, no single entity can tackle them alone. Our industry can lead by sharing tools, intelligence, best practices. We also need to work collaboratively with policymakers, advocacy groups, academics to fully understand emerging threats respond to them. Initiatives like Lantern organizations like Tech Coalition represent kind of collaborative efforts that make it possible for us all to better stay ahead of bad actors work together towards a universally safe online experience for everyone. How We Put Safety at Center of Everything We Build What it means to start with safety As soon as we start building something new, we assess risks that might come from it. By starting at concept phase, we can factor safety into everything we do as we design, build, launch, manage a new product. Throughout process, our teams weigh in with specialized knowledge in their domains, including teen safety, counter-extremism, cybercrime, security, privacy, spam. Functionally, this is how we pinpoint any gaps that may exist as we build products features that make Discord a fun, safe place to hang out with friends. Four key questions for building safer products Any time we build something, we prioritize four key questions to determine our approach to building safer products: There are some things we consider with each product. Weall look, for instance, at our data to learn more about most common kinds of violations that are related to what weare building. That can help us understand most harmful most abundant violations we know about today. But our products donat all have same behaviors content, so we canat just copy-paste our work from one tool to another. Think of Family Center voice messages, for example. They have unique purposes functions, so we needed different answers to each of questions above as we built them. By starting with these questions on day one, we were able to make right decisions for each tool at each step of process maximize our approach to safety in end. By following this approach, everyone involved in making our products has a clear-eyed honest understanding of risks that could potentially arise from our work. We make intentional decisions to minimize those risks commit to only releasing something if it meets our high standard of safety. What starting with safety looks like in practice Letas look a little deeper at voice messages, feature that lets you record audio on your phone easily send it to your friends. Hereas a brief rundown of how we incorporated safety conversations into every aspect of bringing this fun tool to life. At earliest stage, product team drew up preliminary specifications consulted with trust safety subject matter experts on staff. product manager shared specs with individuals from policy legal teams, with a focus on flagging any concerns discrepancies regarding Discordas own policies. Once initial feedback was incorporated, product manager created an action plan, bringing on engineers who began building feature. Even during this stage, safety experts were part of process. In fact, it was here that members of safety team called for an additional requirementaa way for us to handle large amounts of audio messages. Just as users can report written messages, they also can report audio messages for content that violates our policies. Our safety teams needed to ensure we had a way to review those reports effectively as they flow in. In this instance, team had to figure out how audio review process would even work. Would reviewers have to sit listen to hours of reported messages each day? That didnat seem viable, so core team decided to use existing text tools that could transcribe reported messages. Now reviewers can evaluate text quickly, review audio for additional context. Once again, product manager engineers worked closely with safety team to include building in this additional layer of safety. Just because our voice messages feature is live doesnat mean our safety job is complete. We need to understand how effective our methods are, so weave developed metrics that track safety give us insight into impacts of decisions weave made. We track, for instance, if we have unusual rates of flagged content appeals on decisions, as well as breakdown of various violations on our platform. We summarize these metrics in our quarterly Transparency Reports. What it doesnat look like To better understand our safety-centric approach, consider alternative. A different platform could start with an innovative idea best intentions. It could build product it thinks would be most exciting for users, review risk safety implications when itas ready to go live. If company identifies risks at a late stage, it has to decide what to address before releasing product to world. This can happen is flawed. If youare already at finish line when you notice risks youave created, you might realize you have to start over to do it right. Building a product this way is risky, users are ones most exposed to those risks. How Discord starts with safety At Discord, we understand that we have to think about safety growth holistically. Discord is built differently from other platforms. We don't chase virality impressions. Discord makes money by providing users a great experience through premium subscriptions. Under this model, we can focus on our users have more freedom to prioritize safety. Put simply, weare only interested in growing a platform thatas safe. Weare here to help people forge genuine friendships, we know that can only happen when people feel safe connecting with one another.

When we consider adding new privacy features like E2EE A/V, we do not do so in isolation from safety. That is why safety is integrated across our product policies, why messages on Discord are unencrypted. Messages will still be subject to our content moderation approach, allowing us to continue offering additional safety protections.A Privacy is an essential part of feeling secure, we want to be transparent about security technology we use. Thatas why weave also published a technical blog to provide more insight into work, how we got here, our design implementation goals, technical overview of how we built our E2EE A/V protocol.

Navigating Online Boundaries With Your Teen Weare committed to making Discord a safe place for teens to hang out with their friends online. While theyare doing their thing weare doing our part to keep them safe, sometimes itas hard for parents to know whatas actually going on in their teensa online lives. Teens navigate online world with a level of expertise that is often underestimated by adults in their lives. For parents, it may be a hard lesson to fathomathat their teens know best. But why wouldnat they? Every teen is their own leading expert in their life experiences (as we all are!). But growing up online, this generation is particularly adept at what it means to make new friends, find community, express their authentic selves, test boundariesaall online. But that doesnat mean teens donat need adultsa help when it comes to setting healthy digital boundaries. it doesnat mean parents canat be a guide for cultivating safe, age-appropriate spaces. Itas about finding right balance between giving teens agency while creating right moments to check in with them. One of best ways to do that is to encourage more regular, open honest conversations with your teen about staying safe online. Here at Discord, weave developed tools to help that process, like our Family Center: an opt-in program that makes it easy for parents guardians to be informed about their teenas Discord activity while respecting their autonomy. Here are a few more ways to kick off online safety discussions. If a teen feels like they could get in trouble for something, they wonat be honest with you. So go into these conversations from a place of curiosity first, rather than judgment. Here are a few conversation-starters: Teens will be less likely to share if they feel like parents just donat get it, so asking open questions like these will foster more conversation. Questions rooted in blame can also backfire: teen may not be as forthcoming because they feel like adult is already gearing up to punish them. Read more helpful prompts for talking with your teen about online safety in our Discord Safety Center. Our goal at Discord is to make it a place where teens can talk hang out with their friends in a safe, fun way. Itas a place where teens have power agency, where they get to feel like they own something. Just because your teen is having fun online doesn't mean you have to give up your parental role. Parents trusted adults in a teenas life are here to coach guide them, enabling them to explore themselves find out who they areawhile giving them parameters by which to do so. On Discord, some of those boundaries could include: Using Discordas Family Center feature so you can be more informed involved in your teensa online life without prying. At Discord, weave created several tools to help parents stay informed in touch with their teens online, including this Parentas Guide to Discord Family Center. In spirit of meeting teens where they are, weave also introduced a lighthearted way to spur conversations through a set of digital safety tarot cards. Popular with Gen Z, tarot cards are a fun way for teens to self-reflect find meaning in a world that can feel out of control. messages shown in cards encourage teens to be kind to use their intuition trust their instincts. They remind teens to fire up their empathy, while also reminding them itas OK to block those who bring you down. no, these cards will (unfortunately) not tell you your future! But theyare a fun way to initiate discussions about online safety establish a neutral, welcoming space for your teen to share their concerns. They encourage teens to share real-life experiences stories of online encounters, both positive negative. idea is to get young people talking, parents listening. Sometimes, even as adults, it's easy to get in over your head online. Through our research with parents teens, we found that while 30% of parents said their Gen Zeras emotional mental health had taken a turn for worse in past few years, 55% of Gen Z said it. while some teens acknowledged that being extremely online can contribute to that, more reported that online communications platforms, including social media, play a positive role in their life through providing meaningful community connection. Understanding healthy digital boundaries how they can impact mental wellbeing is important, no matter if youare a teen, parent, any age in-between. When it comes to addressing unique safety needs of each individual, there are resources, such as Crisis Text Line. Trained volunteer Crisis Counselors are available to support anyone in their time of need 24/7. Just text DISCORD to 741741 to receive free confidential mental health support in English Spanish. Our Response to Pentagon Leaks Summary of Current Situation Because investigations are ongoing, we can only share limited details. What we can say is that alleged documents were initially shared in a small, invite-only server on Discord. original server has been deleted, but materials have since appeared in several additional servers. Our Terms of Service expressly prohibit using Discord for illegal criminal purposes. This includes sharing of documents that may be verifiably classified. Unlike overwhelming majority of people who find community on Discord, this group departed from norms, broke our rules, did so in apparent violation of law. Our mission is for Discord to be place to hang out with friends online. With that mission comes a responsibility to make Discord a safe positive place for our users. For example, our policies clearly outline that hate speech, threats violent extremism have no place on our platform. When Discordas Trust Safety team learns of content that violates our rules, we act quickly to remove it. In this instance, we have banned users involved with original distribution of materials, deleted content deemed to be against our Terms, issued warnings to users who continue to share materials in question. Our Approach to Delivering a Positive User Experience This recent incident fundamentally represents a misuse of our platform a violation of our platform rules. Our Terms of Service Community Guidelines provide universal rules for what is acceptable activity content on Discord. When we become aware of violations to our policies, we take action. core of our mission is to give everyone power to find create belonging in their lives. Creating a safe environment on Discord is essential to achieve this, is one of ways we prevent misuse of our platform. Safety is at core of everything we do a primary area of investment as a business: fight against bad actors on communications platforms is unlikely to end soon, our approach to safety is guided by following principles: Underpinning all of this are two important considerations: our overall approach towards content moderation our investments in technology solutions to keep our users safe. Our Approach to Content Moderation We currently employ three levers to moderate user content on Discord, while mindful of user privacy: There is constant innovation taking place within beyond Discord to improve how companies can effectively scale deliver content moderation. In future, our approach will continue to evolve, as we are constantly finding new ways to do better for our users. Our Technology Solutions We believe that in long term, machine learning will be an essential component of safety solutions. In 2021, we acquired Sentropy, a leader in AI-powered moderation systems, to advance our work in this domain. We will continue to balance technology with judgment contextual assessment of highly trained employees, as well as continuing to maintain our strong stance on user privacy. Here is an overview of some of our key investments in technology: Our Partnerships In field of online safety, we are inspired by spirit of cooperation across companies civil society groups. We are proud to engage learn from a wide range of companies organizations including: This cooperation extends to our work with law enforcement agencies. When appropriate, Discord complies with information requests from law enforcement agencies while respecting privacy rights of our users. Discord also may disclose information to authorities in emergency situations when we possess a good faith belief that there is imminent risk of serious physical injury death.

Our Response to Tragedy in Buffalo Our Work With Lantern, First Child Safety Cross-Platform Signal Sharing Program Some of most recognizable names in tech such as Snap, Google, Twitch, Meta, Discord unveiled Lantern, a pioneering initiative aimed at thwarting child predators who exploit platform vulnerabilities to elude detection. This vital project marks a significant stride forward in safeguarding children who on average spend up to nine hours a day online. It underscores a critical truth: protecting our children in digital realm is a shared responsibility, necessitating a unified front from both tech behemoths emerging players. digital landscape must be inherently safe, embedding privacy security at its core, not merely as an afterthought. This philosophy propelled my journey to Discord, catalyzed by a profound personal reckoning. In 2017, harrowing discussions about children's online experiences triggered a series of panic attacks for me, leading to a restless quest for solutions. This path culminated, with a gentle nudge from my wife, in creation of a company that used AI to detect online abuse make internet safer for everyone, which was later acquired by Discord. This mission has been remains personal for me! Discord, now an eight-year-old messaging service with mobile, web, stand-alone apps over 150 million monthly users, transcends being just a platform. It's a sanctuary, a space where communities, from gamers to study groups, notably LGBTQ+ teens, find belonging safety. Our ethos is distinct: we don't sell user data clutter experiences with ads. Discord isnat place you go to get famous attract followers. We align our interests squarely with our users, fostering a safe authentic environment. However, our non-social media identity doesn't preclude collaboration with social media companies in safeguarding online spaces. Just as physical venues like airports, stadiums hospitals require tailored security measures, so too do digital platforms need safety solutions that meet their unique architecture. With all different ways that kids experience life online, a one-size-fits-all approach simply wonat work. This is not a solitary endeavor but a collective, industry-wide mandate. Innovating in safety is as crucial as in product features, requiring open-source sharing of advancements knowledge. For example, our team at Discord has independently developed new technologies to better detect child sexual abuse material (CSAM), have chosen to make them open-source so that other platforms can use this technology without paying a penny. tech industry must confront head-on most severe threats online, including sexual exploitation illegal content sharing. Parents rightfully expect digital products used by their children to embody these safety principles. Lantern is a pivotal advancement in this ongoing mission. Yet, as technology evolves, introducing AI, VR, other innovations, safety landscape continually shifts, presenting new challenges that no single entity can tackle alone. millions tech sector invests must be used to ensure users on our platforms are actually safe, not to persuade Washington that theyare safe. Our industry can lead by sharing with each other working collaboratively with legislators, advocacy groups, academics. Collaboration is keyaamong tech companies, legislators, advocacy groups, academicsa to ensure a universally safe online experience for our children. essence of online safety lies in an unprecedented collaborative effort globally. launch of Lantern is not just a step but a leap forward, signaling a new era of shared responsibility action in digital world. Itas time for us to focus on a safer tomorrow! Parents & Educators, Join Us on Discord!

While our Community Guidelines explain what isnat allowed on Discord, these new principles will ultimately guide users to take on a shared responsibility in creating a fun comfortable space to talk hang out with their friends. What weave learned so far Recent focus groups have shown us that teens navigate privacy, safety, authenticity in nuanced sophisticated ways a they expect online platforms to do same.

Weall have other product updates partnership announcements to come! Supreme Court Decision Reaffirms Discordas Right to Keep Your Online Spaces Safe Terms of Service Feedback Changes Context What changed? On October 16th, 2018, we added an arbitration class action waiver clause. To summarize, this clause states that when thereas a disagreement between Discord you, weall use an alternative dispute resolution process known as arbitration. Why did we change it? current legal landscape in United States is such that class action lawsuits can be abused. This clause was added because we are now operating a game store subscription service for profit. Like many other companies, we are now a target for entities who wish to abuse class action lawsuit. If youad like to learn more about legal landscape, arbitration, potential abuse of class action lawsuits, weave included a handful of links in Resources section at bottom of this post. What does that mean for you? We think that people can disagree on whether not arbitration is good in general whether not class action system is one that is beneficial; we donat think itas completely black white. In fact, weare very interested in how Europe is approaching implementing class action lawsuits, as their approach may mitigate issues that United States faces with them. Because we donat think itas black white, one of things that weave implemented (which some of our competitors do not), is to allow you to opt out of this clause completely. We encourage you to opt out if you wish. You wonat be penalized in any way if you do so. At no point will we ever gate any features take any action on users because theyave opted out of arbitration. Changes following changes will be live sometime before October 20th, 2018. United States Exclusivity As we stated above in aWhy did we change it,a our motivation for this change is because of legal climate in United States. To protect our users outside United States, weave decided to modify this clause so that it only affects users in United States. If you are outside of United States, this clause does not apply to you. This means users outside United States do not need to opt out if they were wanting to. Opt Out Extension Furthermore, every user was (or will be if they havenat logged in yet) notified of changes to our Terms of Service on date they were updated by a blue notification bar at top of Discord client. In hindsight, we should have provided notice of these changes much further in advance, so we apologize for that. That said, much of feedback weave received is that our community was not aware of these changes. To provide more opportunity for those who wish to opt out for those who may have overlooked notification bar, weave extended our opt out period from initial 30 days to 90 days. How do I opt out? Stated in our Terms of Service under DISPUTE RESOLUTION: Your opt out doesnat need any specific template form. It just needs request to opt out it must come from email associated with your Discord account. We want to reiterateaaayou will not be penalized in any way for opting out of arbitration. Again, we encourage you to do so if you wish to. a Wrapping Up Thanks again for your feedbackaaaitas important to us as a company that we hear from our community. We really appreciate that you all care so much to voice your opinions. If you have any further questions, please send an email to privacy@discordapp.com weall be happy to answer! a Resources a Teachable Moments Hidden in Plain Sight Using research to help teens build their 'safety muscle' To do that, Discord works with organizations like Digital Wellness Lab at Boston Childrenas Hospital National PTA to understand needs of one of our largest user bases. aWe are experts in technology, not experts in teenagers. So we need to make sure we are pulling in expert research when we're thinking about what it means to be a safe, healthy ultimately, empowering place for young people,a said Liz Hegarty, Discordas global teen safety policy manager.A A Hegarty her colleagues are guided by research, which is empathetic to teens' lived experiences cautions against being overly paternalistic. For example, Digital Wellness Lab advises parents to resist urge to step in solve every problem for their teen, online off. Instead, they recommend asking probing questions talking through decision-making process. This can clear way to have more conversations about digital boundaries. aThese conversations can help teens build their safety musclea, said Hegarty. We built our Family Center with this idea in mind. Launched in 2023, Family Center is an opt-in tool that enables guardians, trusted adults, teens to alinka their accounts. While it allows parents to know who their teen is connected with, tool does not allow adults to see contents of their teenas conversations with friends. aThe key is to find balance between respecting teen autonomy agency while also giving parents ways to check in with their teensa, said Savannah Badalich, Discordas senior director of policy. aParents trusted adults in a teen's life are here to coach them,a said Badalich, who leads team responsible for key safety areas, such as teen safety mental health. aLet them explore themselves, let them find who they are. But give them parameters in which to do so.a There is a risk that a teen may choose not to talk at all if they feel they are being constantly monitored. This is why it's important to follow research. aLeading experts say that sort of parental surveillance does not always help generate safety create a trustworthy environment for teens to talk to their caregivers,a Hegarty said. Hegarty notes that when building Family Center tool, Discord decided to add an additional layer of support. As a teen connects with their parents, Discord surfaces information for Crisis Text Line (note that this is for users in U.S. only). This is a support line that provides free, 24/7 mental health support via text, WhatsApp, web chat. idea is to provide available resources to teens to encourage them to seek help if they need it. Itas another way we embed subtle lessons throughout experience. Weaving in teachable moments Discordas Teen Safety Assist includes two recently released safety features: one for when a teen receives a direct message (DM) from a user for first time, another that blurs potentially sensitive content in DMs group DMs with friends. When an alert is triggered, teen might see a pop-up that says, Unwanted message? If you donat want to chat with this person, you can block mute them.A They can then click to alearn more,a see a message that prompts aUnwanted message?a, as well as provides a set of tips for handling situation.a a aIt's this idea of educating as opposed to just punishing teenagers when they make mistakes,a said Hegarty. aIn moment, itas important to give teens resources, autonomy, agency, help.a Hegarty points to research about how teens are nervous to block other people. They're worried if person finds out they're blocked, teen is going to look uncool. Meanwhile, if they report, they arenat sure what will happen next. They are anxious about getting somebody in trouble. Research from Thorn, a leading child welfare nonprofit, also suggests that when teens encounter a potentially harmful experience online, they are less likely to seek support offline, such as talking to a trusted adult. So Discord is trying to meet teens where they are. aIt's not a paternalistic approach that protects teens from everything. Being overly restrictive risks them lacking necessary skills to move within world once they turn 18,a said Badalich. aInstead, let's educate them throughout their experience. Let's give them tools to control their experience.a Giving teens opportunities to learn Risk-taking is part of growing up. Itas part of being a teenager. aBecause their brain is still developing, they need options, time education,a said Badalich, whose team is also working to sharpen Discordas enforcement system with teens in mind. When it comes to developing policies rules that govern platform, Badalich her team are rethinking what that looks like, with understanding that teens need extra opportunities to learn. aKeep up, take down, ban have been main levers. we're continuing to explore even more ways to take necessary action,a said Badalich. For example, aWhen you think about someone talking about self-harm, do we really want to penalize them? do we want to figure out some other form of intervention?a To be clear, when it comes to most severe violationsasuch as those involving violent extremism content that sexualizes childrenaDiscord will continue to have a zero-tolerance policy. But when it comes to building out more nuanced, research-driven policies, policy team looks to lessons from restorative justice, a concept that recognizes that people are capable of change. aInstead of just being purely punitive all of time,a said Badalich, aDiscord wants to move in direction of where we are giving people opportunities to change, grow, learn.a Upholding Our Commitment to Safety in 2023 Beyond Product Developments Discordas ground-up approach to safety starts with our product features. Not only do we intentionally build products that help to keep our users safer, but we also implement a Safety by Design practice, which includes a risk assessment process during product development cycle that helps identify mitigate potential risks to user safety. This year, we made key investments that help teens, parents, all of our users have a positive Discord experience: Partnerships We believe that everyone in industry should share solutions, intelligence, technology, which is why we continued to invest in furthering our partnerships with a number of safety organizations this year. These organizations help us to keep our platform internet safer by supplementing our expertise insights helping us to continue to advance cutting edge safety efforts. As part of our extensive fight against child sexual abuse material (CSAM), we continued to deepen our partnership with Tech Coalition. I joined Tech Coalitionas Board of Directors am excited to help shape organizationas future continue to collaborate with industry leaders to combat online sexual abuse exploitation. One of most exciting parts of our partnership with Tech Coalition this year was launch of Lantern, a first-of-its-kind signal sharing program for companies to enhance strengthen how we detect attempts to sexually exploit abuse children teens online. Discord joined other industry partners like Google, Mega, Meta, Quora, Roblox, Snap, Twitch to share signals about activity we detect that violates our policies utilize signals shared by other companies to surface violating activity on their platforms. We also expanded our partnership with INHOPE, a global network combatting CSAM online. Through this partnership, we are better able to collaborate with hotlines globally working to address this important issue. We joined Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), UKas frontline defense against spread of online child sexual abuse imagery. By becoming a member, Discord will be able to deploy IWFas world-leading services to keep platform safer, including IWFas URL List Keywords List, as well as its Non-Photographic URL Hash Lists. Discord also joined Christchurch Call, a community of over 120 members worldwide with a shared goal of eliminating violent extremism online. Partnership transparency are cornerstones of our effort to counter extremism we are committed to working collectively with this global community to make internet world a safer place. Discord is partnering with European Center for Not-for-Profit Law to lead a pilot project to implement their Framework for Meaningful Engagement (FME). ECNLas expertise FME will help us build deploy AI systems in support of our safety work. We continued our important partnership with National PTA around family engagement efforts. Through their Build Up Belong program, we supported local PTAs as they hosted events to help families build healthy digital habits foster productive conversations about navigating online interactions.A Additionally, we are proud board members of Digital Trust & Safety Partnership, which gathers tech platforms to collaborate on publish online safety best practices. This includes conducting audits of our policies processes to ensure safety is built into our systems by design. We also are active members of Trust & Safety Professional Association, an organization that gathers Trust & Safety professionals from around world for training to share best practices across industry. Looking to 2024 beyond As technologies continue to evolve, so does dynamic safety landscape, presenting new challenges that no company government can tackle alone. Continued industry investment in safety features must be made to ensure users on our platforms are safer. We can do this by evolving our features policies to ensure they are up to date, holistic, meet needs of our users; regularly sharing knowledge progress; working collaboratively with each other legislators, advocacy groups, academics, to ensure a safer online experience for everyone. While weave made a lot of progress over last year, we know there is still much more we can must do a on our own in collaboration with others a to combat known new threats. work here never stops. As we look to New Year, my team I are as committed as ever to building on important safety work weave done over past twelve months, we are confident that Discord will continue to be best place for people to have fun online.
